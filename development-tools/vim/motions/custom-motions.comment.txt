<p>Vim's standard set of motions is fairly comprehensive, but we can augment it further by defining new motions and text objects.</p>

<p>Kana Natsuno's <a href="https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-entire">textobj-entire plugin</a> is a good example. It adds two new text objects to Vim: <mark>ie</mark> and <mark>ae</mark>, which act upon the entire file.</p>

<p>If we wanted to autoindent the entire file using the <mark>=</mark> command, we could run <mark>gg=G</mark>.</p>

<p>But if we had the textobj-entire plugin installed, we could simply run <mark>=ae</mark>. It wouldn't matter where our cursor was when we ran this command; it would always act upon the entire file.</p>

<p>Note that if we had both the <i>commentary</i> and <i>textobj-entire</i> plugins installed, we could use them together. Running <mark>gcae</mark> would toggle commenting throughout the current file.</p>
