<p>You may find that some things don’t work for you the way that they are described in the text.</p>

<p>Try quitting Vim and then launching it with these options:</p> 

<pre class="language-bash">
    <code>
        vim -u NONE -N
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
The -u NONE flag tells Vim not to source your vimrc on startup.<br/>
That way, your customizations won’t be applied and plugins will be disabled.
</p>

<p>
When Vim starts up without loading a vimrc file, it reverts to vi compatible mode, which causes many useful features to be disabled.<br/>
The -N flag prevents this by setting the ‘nocompatible’ option.
</p>

<p>
Some of Vim’s built-in features are implemented with Vim script, which means that they will only work when plugins are enabled.<br/>
This file contains the absolute minimum configuration that is required to activate Vim’s built-in plugins:
</p>

<cite>path/to/vimrc</cite>
<pre class="language-vim">
    <code>
        set compatible
        filetype plugin on
    </code>
</pre>

<p>When launching Vim, you can use this file instead of your default vimrc by running the following:</p>

<pre class="language-bash">
    <code>
        vim -u path/to/vimrc
    </code>
</pre>
