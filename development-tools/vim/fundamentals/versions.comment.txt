<p>(See <b>:h +feature-list</b> )</p>

<p>Some of Vimâ€™s functionality can be disabled during compilation. For example, when configuring the build, we could provide the <code>--with-features=tiny</code> option, which would disable all but the most fundamental features (there are also feature sets labeled small, normal, big, and huge). You can browse the feature list by looking up [<b>:h +feature-list</b>]</p>
