<p>Normal, Insert, and Visual modes are readily identified, but Vim has other modes that are easy to overlook. Operator-Pending mode is a case in point. We use it dozens of times daily, but it usually lasts for just a fraction of a second. For example, we invoke it when we run the command dw. It lasts during the brief interval between pressing d and w keys. Blink and you'll miss it!</p>

<p>If we think of Vim as a finite-state machine, then Operator-Pending mode is a state that accepts only motion commands. It is activated when we invoke an operator command, and then nothing happens until we provide a motion, which completes the operation. While Operator-Pending mode is active, we can return to Normal mode in the usual manner by pressing escape, which aborts the operation.</p>

<p>Many commands are invoked by two or more keystrokes (for examples, look up <mark>:hg</mark> , <mark>:h z</mark> , <mark>:h ctrl-w</mark> , or <mark>:h [</mark> ), but in most cases, the first keystroke merely acts as a prefix for the second. These commands don't initiate Operator-Pending mode. Instead, we can think of them as namespaces that expand the number of available command mappings. Only the operator commands initiate Operator-Pending mode.</p>

<p>Why, you might be wondering, is an entire mode dedicated to those brief moments between invoking operator and motion commands, whereas the namespaced com-mands are merely an extension of Normal mode? Good question! Because we can create custom mappings that initiate or target Operator-Pending mode. In other words, it allows us to create custom operators and motions, which in turn allows us to expand Vim's vocabulary.</p>
