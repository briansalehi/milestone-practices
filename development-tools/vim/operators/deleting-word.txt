(See <b>:h aw</b> )
<br/>

Suppose that our cursor is positioned in the middle of a word and we want to
delete that word.

We might begin by deleting the word backward by pressing <mark>db</mark>
command sequence.

Or moving back and deleting forward by pressing <mark>b</mark> followed by
<mark>dw</mark>.

Both of our solutions so far have involved some kind of preparation or
clean-up. We can be more surgical by using the <mark>aw</mark> text object
instead of a motion, which makes up our command to <mark>daw</mark>.

The <mark>daw</mark> command is easily remembered by the mnemonic <i>delete a
word</i>.
