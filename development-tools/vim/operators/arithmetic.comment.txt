<p>Vim interprets numerals with a leading zero to be in octal notation rather than in decimal.</p>

<p>If you work with octal numbers frequently, Vim's default behavior might suit you. If you don't, you probably want to add the following line to your vimrc:</p>

<pre class="language-vim">
    <code>
        set nrformats=
    </code>
</pre>

<p>This will cause Vim to treat all numerals as decimal, regardless of whether they are padded with zeros.</p>
