<p>(See <b>:h aw</b> )</p>

<p>Suppose that our cursor is positioned in the middle of a word and we want to delete that word.</p>

<p>We might begin by deleting the word backward by pressing <mark>db</mark> command sequence.</p>

<p>Or moving back and deleting forward by pressing <mark>b</mark> followed by <mark>dw</mark>.</p>

<p>Both of our solutions so far have involved some kind of preparation or clean-up. We can be more surgical by using the <mark>aw</mark> text object instead of a motion, which makes up our command to <mark>daw</mark>.</p>

<p>The <mark>daw</mark> command is easily remembered by the mnemonic <i>delete a word</i>.</p>
