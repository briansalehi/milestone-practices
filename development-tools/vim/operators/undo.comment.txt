<p>In other text editors, invoking the undo command after typing a few words might revert the last typed word or character. However, in Vim we can control the granularity of the undo command.</p>

<p>The <mark>u</mark> key triggers the undo command, which reverts the most recent change.</p>

<p>In Vim, we can control the granularity of the undo command. From the moment we enter Insert mode until we return to Normal mode, everything we type (or delete) counts as a single change. So we can make the undo command operate on words, sentences, or paragraphs just by moderating our use of the <mark>&lt;Esc&gt;</mark> key.</p>

<p>So how often should you leave Insert mode? It’s a matter of preference, but I like to make each “undoable chunk” correspond to a thought.</p>
