<p>(See <b>:h :map-operator</b> )</p>

<p>The number of actions that we can perform using Vim's default set of operators and motions is vast. But we can expand these even further by rolling our own custom motions and operators.</p>

<p>
The standard set of operators that ships with Vim is relatively small, but it is possible to define new ones. Tim Pope's <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">commentary.vim plugin</a> provides a good example.<br/>
This adds a command for commenting and uncommenting lines of code in all languages supported by Vim.
</p>

<p>
The commentary command is triggered by <mark>gc{motion}</mark>, which toggles commenting for the specified lines.<br/>
It's an operator command, so we can combine it with all of the usual motions.<br/>
<mark>gcap</mark> will toggle commenting for the current paragraph.<br/>
<mark>gcG</mark> comments from the current line to the end of the file.<br/>
<mark>gcc</mark> comments the current line.
