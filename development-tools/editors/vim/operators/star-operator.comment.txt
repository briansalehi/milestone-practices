(see [<b>:h *</b>] )
<br/>

<mark>*</mark> command executes a search for the word under the cursor.

Two things should happen:
The cursor will jump forward to the next match, and all occurrences will be
highlighted. If you donâ€™t see any highlighting, try running [<b>:set
hls</b>].

To jump to next match, type <mark>n</mark> command.
