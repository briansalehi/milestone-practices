You may find that some things don’t work for you the way that they are described in the text.

Try quitting Vim and then launching it with these options: 

<pre class="language-bash">
    <code>
        vim -u NONE -N
    </code>
</pre>

The -u NONE flag tells Vim not to source your vimrc on startup.
That way, your customizations won’t be applied and plugins will be
disabled.

When Vim starts up without loading a vimrc file, it reverts to vi compatible
mode, which causes many useful features to be disabled. The -N flag prevents
this by setting the ‘nocompatible’ option.

Some of Vim’s built-in features are implemented with Vim script, which
means that they will only work when plugins are enabled.
This file contains the absolute minimum configuration that is required to
activate Vim’s built-in plugins:

<cite>path/to/vimrc</cite>
<pre class="language-vim">
    <code>
        set compatible
        filetype plugin on
    </code>
</pre>

When launching Vim, you can use this file instead of your default vimrc by
running the following:

<pre class="language-bash">
    <code>
        vim -u path/to/vimrc
    </code>
</pre>
