<p>In centralized systems, every developer is a node working more or less equally with a central hub. In Git, however, every developer is potentially both a node and a hub; that is, every developer can both contribute code to other repositories and maintain a public repository on which others can base their work and which they can contribute to. This presents a vast range of workflow possibilities for your project and/or your team, so we’ll cover a few common paradigms that take advantage of this flexibility. We’ll go over the strengths and possible weaknesses of each design; you can choose a single one to use, or you can mix and match features from each.</p>

<h4>Centralized Workflow</h4>

<p>In centralized systems, there is generally a single collaboration model — the <b>centralized workflow</b>. One central hub, or repository, can accept code, and everyone synchronizes their work with it. A number of developers are nodes — consumers of that hub — and synchronize with that centralized location.</p>

![centralized-workflow.png]

<p>This means that if two developers clone from the hub and both make changes, the first developer to push their changes back up can do so with no problems. The second developer must merge in the first one’s work before pushing changes up, so as not to overwrite the first developer’s changes.</p>

<p>If you are already comfortable with a centralized workflow in your company or team, you can easily continue using that workflow with Git. Simply set up a single repository, and give everyone on your team push access; Git won’t let users overwrite each other.</p>

<p>This workflow is attractive to a lot of people because it’s a paradigm that many are familiar and comfortable with.</p>

<p>This is also not limited to small teams. With Git’s branching model, it’s possible for hundreds of developers to successfully work on a single project through dozens of branches simultaneously.</p>

<h4>Integration-Manager Workflow</h4>

<p>Because Git allows you to have multiple remote repositories, it’s possible to have a workflow where each developer has write access to their own public repository and read access to everyone else’s. This scenario often includes a canonical repository that represents the “official” project. To contribute to that project, you create your own public clone of the project and push your changes to it. Then, you can send a request to the maintainer of the main project to pull in your changes. The maintainer can then add your repository as a remote, test your changes locally, merge them into their branch, and push back to their repository. The process works as follows.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The project maintainer pushes to their public repository.</li>
	<li>A contributor clones that repository and makes changes.</li>
	<li>The contributor pushes to their own public copy.</li>
	<li>The contributor sends the maintainer an email asking them to pull changes.</li>
	<li>The maintainer adds the contributor’s repository as a remote and merges locally.</li>
	<li>The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository.</li>
</ul>

![integration-manager-workflow.png]

<p>This is a very common workflow with hub-based tools like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, where it’s easy to fork a project and push your changes into your fork for everyone to see. One of the main advantages of this approach is that you can continue to work, and the maintainer of the main repository can pull in your changes at any time. Contributors don’t have to wait for the project to incorporate their changes — each party can work at their own pace.</p>

<h4>Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow</h4>

<p>This is a variant of a multiple-repository workflow. It’s generally used by huge projects with hundreds of collaborators; one famous example is the <a href="https://kernel.org">Linux kernel</a>. Various integration managers are in charge of certain parts of the repository; they’re called <b>lieutenants</b>. All the <b>lieutenants</b> have one <b>integration manager</b> known as the <b>benevolent dictator</b>. The <b>benevolent dictator</b> pushes from their directory to a reference repository from which all the collaborators need to pull. The process works like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Regular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of master.</li>
	<li>The master branch is that of the reference repository to which the dictator pushes.</li>
	<li>Lieutenants merge the developers' topic branches into their master branch.</li>
	<li>The dictator merges the lieutenants' master branches into the dictator’s master branch.</li>
	<li>Finally, the dictator pushes that master branch to the reference repository so the other developers can rebase on it.</li>
</ul>

![benevolent-dictator-workflow.png]

<p>This kind of workflow isn’t common, but can be useful in very big projects, or in highly hierarchical environments. It allows the project leader (the dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect large subsets of code at multiple points before integrating them.</p>

<h4>Commit Guidelines</h4>

<p>First, your submissions should not contain any whitespace errors. Git provides an easy way to check for this — before you commit, run <code>git diff --check</code>, which identifies possible whitespace errors and lists them for you.</p>

<p>Next, try to make each commit a logically separate changeset.</p>

<p>If some of the changes modify the same file, try to use <code>git add --patch</code> to partially stage files.</p>

<p>Your messages should start with a single line that’s no more than about 50 characters and that describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation.</p>

<p>Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."</p>

<p>Here is a template you can follow: Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72 characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase will confuse you if you run the two together.</p>

<p>Write your commit message in the imperative: "<b>Fix bug</b>" and not "<b>Fixed bug</b>" or "<b>Fixes bug</b>". This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like <code>git merge</code> and <code>git revert</code>.</p>

<p>Further paragraphs come after blank lines.</p>

<p>Bullet points are okay, too.</p>

<p>Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here.</p>

<p>Use a hanging indent.</p>

<h4>Private Managed Team</h4>

<p>Let’s say that John and Jessica are working together on one feature (call this “<b>featureA</b>”), while Jessica and a third developer, Josie, are working on a second (say, “<b>featureB</b>”). In this case, the company is using a type of <b>integration-manager workflow</b> where the work of the individual groups is integrated only by certain engineers, and the master branch of the main repo can be updated only by those engineers. In this scenario, all work is done in team-based branches and pulled together by the integrators later.</p>

<p>Let’s say that John and Jessica are working together on one feature (call this “<b>featureA</b>”), while Jessica and a third developer, Josie, are working on a second (say, “<b>featureB</b>”). In this case, the company is using a type of <b>integration-manager workflow</b> where the work of the individual groups is integrated only by certain engineers, and the master branch of the main repo can be updated only by those engineers. In this scenario, all work is done in team-based branches and pulled together by the integrators later.</p>

<p>Jessica doesn’t have push access to the master branch — only the integrators do — so she has to push to another branch in order to collaborate with John:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-4" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git push -u origin featureA
		...
		To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
		* [new branch]	  featureA -> featureA
	</code>
</pre>

<p>She starts a new feature branch, basing it off the server’s master branch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="4" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git fetch origin

		git checkout -b featureB origin/master
		Switched to a new branch 'featureB'Now, Jessica makes a couple of commits on the featureB branch:

		vim lib/simplegit.rb

		git commit -am 'Make ls-tree function recursive'

		vim lib/simplegit.rb

		git commit -am 'Add ls-files'
	</code>
</pre>

![jessica-init-commit.png]

<p>She’s ready to push her work, but gets an email from Josie that a branch with some initial “<b>featureB</b>” work on it was already pushed to the server as the <b>featureBee</b> branch. Jessica needs to merge those changes with her own before she can push her work to the server. Jessica first fetches Josie’s changes with git fetch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-4" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git fetch origin
		...
		From jessica@githost:simplegit
		 * [new branch]      featureBee -> origin/featureBee
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Assuming Jessica is still on her checked-out <b>featureB</b> branch, she can now merge Josie’s work into that branch with git merge:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git merge origin/featureBee
	</code>
</pre>

<p>At this point, Jessica wants to push all of this merged “<b>featureB</b>” work back to the server, but she doesn’t want to simply push her own <b>featureB</b> branch. Rather, since Josie has already started an upstream <b>featureBee</b> branch, Jessica wants to push to that branch, which she does with:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-4" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git push -u origin featureB:featureBee
		...
		To jessica@githost:simplegit.git
		   fba9af8..cd685d1  featureB -> featureBee
	</code>
</pre>

<p>This is called a <b>refspec</b>. Also notice the <code>-u</code> flag; this is short for <code>--set-upstream</code>, which configures the branches for easier pushing and pulling later.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Jessica gets email from John, who tells her he’s pushed some changes to the featureA branch on which they are collaborating, and he asks Jessica to take a look at them. Again, Jessica runs a simple git fetch to fetch all new content from the server, including (of course) John’s latest work:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-4" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git fetch origin
		...
		From jessica@githost:simplegit
		   3300904..aad881d  featureA   -> origin/featureA
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Jessica can display the log of John’s new work by comparing the content of the newly-fetched <b>featureA</b> branch with her local copy of the same branch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git log featureA..origin/featureA
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If Jessica likes what she sees, she can merge John’s new work into her local <b>featureA</b> branch with:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,5" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git checkout featureA
		Switched to branch 'featureA'

		git merge origin/featureA
		Updating 3300904..aad881d
	</code>
</pre>

<h4>Forked Public Project</h4>

<p>Contributing to public projects is a bit different. Because you don’t have the permissions to directly update branches on the project, you have to get the work to the maintainers some other way.</p>

<p>First, you’ll probably want to clone the main repository, create a topic branch for the patch or patch series you’re planning to contribute, and do your work there. The sequence looks basically like this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="4,6" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git clone &lt;url&gt;
		cd project
		git checkout -b featureA
		  ... work ...
		git commit
		  ... work ...
		git commit
	</code>
</pre>

<p>When your branch work is finished and you’re ready to contribute it back to the maintainers, go to the original project page and click the “Fork” button, creating your own writable fork of the project. You then need to add this repository URL as a new remote of your local repository; in this example, let’s call it myfork:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git remote add myfork &lt;url&gt;
	</code>
</pre>

<p>You then need to push your new work to this repository. It’s easiest to push the topic branch you’re working on to your forked repository, rather than merging that work into your <b>master</b> branch and pushing that. The reason is that if your work isn’t accepted or is <code>cherry-pick</code>ed, you don’t have to rewind your <b>master</b> branch</p>

<p>In any event, you can push your work with:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git push -u myfork featureA
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Once your work has been pushed to your fork of the repository, you need to notify the maintainers of the original project that you have work you’d like them to merge. This is often called a pull request, or you can run the <code>git request-pull</code> command and email the subsequent output to the project maintainer manually.</p>

<p>The <code>git request-pull</code> command takes the base branch into which you want your topic branch pulled and the Git repository URL you want them to pull from, and produces a summary of all the changes you’re asking to be pulled.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git request-pull origin/master myfork
	</code>
</pre>

<p>This output can be sent to the maintainer — it tells them where the work was branched from, summarizes the commits, and identifies from where the new work is to be pulled.</p>

<p>If you want to submit a second topic of work to the project, don’t continue working on the topic branch you just pushed up — start over from the main repository’s master branch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,6" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git checkout -b featureB origin/master
		  ... work ...
		git commit
		git push myfork featureB
		git request-pull origin/master myfork
		  ... email generated request pull to maintainer ...
		git fetch origin
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Let’s say the project maintainer has pulled in a bunch of other patches and tried your first branch, but it no longer cleanly merges. In this case, you can try to rebase that branch on top of <b>origin/master</b>, resolve the conflicts for the maintainer, and then resubmit your changes:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,6" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git checkout featureA
		git rebase origin/master
		git push -f myfork featureA
	</code>
</pre>

![jessica-commit-history-after-workA.png]

<p>Because you rebased the branch, you have to specify the <code>-f</code> to your push command in order to be able to replace the <b>featureA</b> branch on the server with a commit that isn’t a descendant of it.</p>

<p>Let’s look at one more possible scenario: the maintainer has looked at work in your second branch and likes the concept but would like you to change an implementation detail. You’ll also take this opportunity to move the work to be based off the project’s current <b>master</b> branch. You start a new branch based off the current <b>origin/master</b> branch, squash the <b>featureB</b> changes there, resolve any conflicts, make the implementation change, and then push that as a new branch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="3" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git checkout -b featureBv2 origin/master
		git merge --squash featureB
		  ... change implementation ...
		git commit
		git push myfork featureBv2
	</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>--squash</code> option takes all the work on the merged branch and squashes it into one changeset producing the repository state as if a real merge happened, without actually making a merge commit. This means your future commit will have one parent only and allows you to introduce all the changes from another branch and then make more changes before recording the new commit. Also the <code>--no-commit</code> option can be useful to delay the merge commit in case of the default merge process.</p>

![jessica-commit-history-after-featureBv2.png]

<h4>Public Project over Email</h4>

<p>Many projects have established procedures for accepting patches — you’ll need to check the specific rules for each project, because they will differ. Instead of forking the project and pushing to your own writable version, you generate email versions of each commit series and email them to the developer mailing list.</p>

<p>You use <code>git format-patch</code> to generate the mbox-formatted files that you can email to the list — it turns each commit into an email message with the first line of the commit message as the subject and the rest of the message plus the patch that the commit introduces as the body. The nice thing about this is that applying a patch from an email generated with <code>format-patch</code> preserves all the commit information properly.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git format-patch -M origin/master
		0001-add-limit-to-log-function.patch0002-increase-log-output-to-30-from-25.patch
	</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>format-patch</code> command prints out the names of the patch files it creates. The <code>-M</code> switch tells Git to look for renames.</p>

<p>Git provides a tool to help you send properly formatted patches via IMAP. You can read detailed instructions for a number of mail programs at the end of the aforementioned <b>Documentation/SubmittingPatches</b> file in the Git source code.</p>

<p>First, you need to set up the imap section in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. You can set each value separately with a series of <code>git config</code> commands, or you can add them manually, but in the end your config file should look something like this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash">
	<code>
		[imap]
		  folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"
		  host = imaps://imap.gmail.com
		  user = user@gmail.com
		  pass = YX]8g76G_2^sFbd
		  port = 993
		  sslverify = false
	</code>
</pre>

<p>When that is set up, you can use <code>git imap-send</code> to place the patch series in the Drafts folder of the specified IMAP server:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-6" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		cat *.patch | git imap-send
		Resolving imap.gmail.com... ok
		Connecting to [74.125.142.109]:993... ok
		Logging in...
		sending 2 messages
		100% (2/2) done
	</code>
</pre>

<p>At this point, you should be able to go to your Drafts folder, change the To field to the mailing list you’re sending the patch to, possibly <b>CC</b> the maintainer or person responsible for that section, and send it off.</p>

<p>You can also send the patches through an SMTP server. As before, you can set each value separately with a series of <code>git config</code> commands, or you can add them manually in the sendemail section in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<pre class="language-bash">
	<code>
		[sendemail]
		  smtpencryption = tls
		  smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
		  smtpuser = user@gmail.com
		  smtpserverport = 587
	</code>
</pre>

<p>After this is done, you can use <code>git send-email</code> to send your patches:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git send-email *.patch
	</code>
</pre>

<h4>Maintaining a Project</h4>

<p>In addition to knowing how to contribute effectively to a project, you’ll likely need to know how to maintain one. This can consist of accepting and applying patches generated via <code>format-patch</code> and emailed to you, or integrating changes in remote branches for repositories you’ve added as remotes to your project.</p>

<p>When you’re thinking of integrating new work, it’s generally a good idea to try it out in a <b>topic branch</b>.</p>

<p>As you’ll remember, you can create the branch based off your master branch like this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git branch sc/ruby_client master
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Or, if you want to also switch to it immediately, you can use the <code>checkout -b</code> option:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git checkout -b sc/ruby_client master
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If you receive a patch over email that you need to integrate into your project, you need to apply the <b>patch</b> in your <b>topic branch</b> to evaluate it. There are two ways to apply an emailed patch: with <code>git apply</code> or with <code>git am</code>.</p>

<p>If you received the patch from someone who generated it with <code>git diff</code>, you can apply it with the <code>git apply</code> command. Assuming you saved the patch at <code>/tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch</code>, you can apply the patch like this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git apply /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch
	</code>
</pre>

<p>This modifies the files in your working directory. It’s almost identical to running a <code>patch -p1</code> command to apply the patch, although it’s more paranoid and accepts fewer fuzzy matches than patch. It also handles file adds, deletes, and renames if they’re described in the <code>git diff</code> format, which patch won’t do. Finally, <code>git apply</code> is an “apply all or abort all” model where either everything is applied or nothing is, whereas <code>patch</code> can partially apply patchfiles, leaving your working directory in a weird state. <code>git apply</code> is overall much more conservative than patch. It won’t create a commit for you — after running it, you must stage and commit the changes introduced manually.</p>

<p>You can also use git apply to see if a patch applies cleanly before you try actually applying it — you can run git apply --check with the patch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,3" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git apply --check 0001-see-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
			error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
			error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If there is no output, then the patch should apply cleanly. This command also exits with a non-zero status if the check fails, so you can use it in scripts if you want.</p>

<p>To apply a patch generated by <code>format-patch</code>, you use <code>git am</code> (the command is named <b>am</b> as it is used to "<i>apply a series of patches from a mailbox</i>"). Technically, <code>git am</code> is built to read an mbox file, which is a simple, plain-text format for storing one or more email messages in one text file.</p>

<p>If someone has emailed you the patch properly using <code>git send-email</code>, and you download that into an mbox format, then you can point <code>git am</code> to that mbox file, and it will start applying all the patches it sees.</p>

<p>However, if someone uploaded a patch file generated via <code>git format-patch</code> to a ticketing system or something similar, you can save the file locally and then pass that file saved on your disk to <code>git am</code> to apply it:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git am 0001-limit-log-function.patch
		Applying: Add limit to log function
	</code>
</pre>

<p>It’s possible that the patch won’t apply cleanly. Perhaps your main branch has diverged too far from the branch the patch was built from, or the patch depends on another patch you haven’t applied yet. In that case, the git am process will fail and ask you what you want to do:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,3" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git am 0001-see-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
		Applying: See if this helps the gem
		error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
	</code>
</pre>

<p>This command puts conflict markers in any files it has issues with, much like a conflicted merge or rebase operation. You solve this issue much the same way — edit the file to resolve the conflict, stage the new file, and then run <code>git am --resolved</code> to continue to the next patch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		(fix the file)
		git add ticgit.gemspec
		git am --resolved
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If you’re applying a number of patches from an mbox, you can also run the <code>am</code> command in interactive mode, which stops at each patch it finds and asks if you want to apply it:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git am -3 -i mbox
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If your contribution came from a Git user who set up their own repository, pushed a number of changes into it, and then sent you the URL to the repository and the name of the remote branch the changes are in, you can add them as a remote and do merges locally.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="jessica" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git remote add jessica git://github.com/jessica/myproject.git
		git fetch jessica
		git checkout -b rubyclient jessica/ruby-client
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If she emails you again later with another branch containing another great feature, you could directly fetch and checkout because you already have the remote setup.</p>

<p>If you aren’t working with a person consistently but still want to pull from them in this way, you can provide the URL of the remote repository to the <code>git pull</code> command. This does a one-time pull and doesn’t save the URL as a remote reference:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git pull https://github.com/onetimeguy/project
	</code>
</pre>

<p>It’s often helpful to get a review of all the commits that are in this branch but that aren’t in your master branch. You can exclude commits in the master branch by adding the <code>--not</code> option before the branch name. This does the same thing as the <code>master..contrib</code> format that we used earlier. For example, if your contributor sends you two patches and you create a branch called <b>contrib</b> and applied those patches there, you can run this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git log contrib --not master
	</code>
</pre>

<p>To see what changes each commit introduces, remember that you can pass the <code>-p</code> option to <code>git log</code> and it will append the diff introduced to each commit.</p>

<p>To see a full diff of what would happen if you were to merge this topic branch with another branch, you may have to use a weird trick to get the correct results. You may think to run this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git diff master
	</code>
</pre>

<p>This command gives you a diff, but it may be misleading. If your master branch has moved forward since you created the topic branch from it, then you’ll get seemingly strange results. This happens because Git directly compares the snapshots of the last commit of the topic branch you’re on and the snapshot of the last commit on the master branch. For example, if you’ve added a line in a file on the master branch, a direct comparison of the snapshots will look like the topic branch is going to remove that line.</p>

<p>If master is a direct ancestor of your topic branch, this isn’t a problem; but if the two histories have diverged, the diff will look like you’re adding all the new stuff in your topic branch and removing everything unique to the master branch.</p>

<p>What you really want to see are the changes added to the topic branch — the work you’ll introduce if you merge this branch with master. You do that by having Git compare the last commit on your topic branch with the first common ancestor it has with the master branch.</p>

<p>Technically, you can do that by explicitly figuring out the common ancestor and then running your diff on it:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git merge-base contrib master
		36c7dba2c95e6bbb78dfa822519ecfec6e1ca649

		git diff 36c7dbor, more concisely:
		git diff $(git merge-base contrib master)
	</code>
</pre>

<p>However, neither of those is particularly convenient, so Git provides another shorthand for doing the same thing: the triple-dot syntax. In the context of the <code>git diff</code> command, you can put three periods after another branch to do a diff between the last commit of the branch you’re on and its common ancestor with another branch:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-6" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git diff master...contrib
	</code>
</pre>

<p>This command shows you only the work your current topic branch has introduced since its common ancestor with <b>master</b>. That is a very useful syntax to remember.</p>

<p>A <code>cherry-pick</code> in Git is like a rebase for a single commit. It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you’re currently on.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have a project that looks like this:</p>

![cherry-pick-history.png]

<p>If you want to pull commit e43a6 into your master branch, you can run:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git cherry-pick e43a6
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Now your history looks like this:</p>

![history-after-cherry-pick.png]

<p>Now you can remove your topic branch and drop the commits you didn’t want to pull in.</p>

<p>If you’re doing lots of merging and rebasing, or you’re maintaining a long-lived topic branch, Git has a feature called “rerere” that can help.</p>

<p><b>Rerere</b> stands for “<b>reuse recorded resolution</b>” — it’s a way of shortcutting manual conflict resolution. When rerere is enabled, Git will keep a set of pre- and post-images from successful merges, and if it notices that there’s a conflict that looks exactly like one you’ve already fixed, it’ll just use the fix from last time, without bothering you with it.</p>

<p>This feature comes in two parts: a configuration setting and a <b>command</b>. The configuration setting is <code>rerere.enabled</code>, and it’s handy enough to put in your global config:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git config --global rerere.enabled true
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, whenever you do a merge that resolves conflicts, the resolution will be recorded in the cache in case you need it in the future.</p>

<p>If you need to, you can interact with the <b>rerere cache</b> using the <code>git rerere</code> command. When it’s invoked alone, Git checks its database of resolutions and tries to find a match with any current merge conflicts and resolve them (although this is done automatically if <code>rerere.enabled</code> is set to <code>true</code>). There are also subcommands to see what will be recorded, to erase specific resolution from the cache, and to clear the entire cache.</p>

<h4>Tagging Your Releases</h4>

<p>If you decide to sign the tag as the maintainer, the tagging may look something like this:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If you do sign your tags, you may have the problem of distributing the public PGP key used to sign your tags. The maintainer of the Git project has solved this issue by including their public key as a blob in the repository and then adding a tag that points directly to that content. To do this, you can figure out which key you want by running <code>gpg --list-keys</code>:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		gpg --list-keys
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Then, you can directly import the key into the Git database by exporting it and piping that through <code>git hash-object</code>, which writes a new blob with those contents into Git and gives you back the SHA-1 of the blob:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		gpg -a --export F721C45A | git hash-object -w --stdin
		659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Now that you have the contents of your key in Git, you can create a tag that points directly to it by specifying the new SHA-1 value that the <code>hash-object</code> command gave you:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git tag -a maintainer-pgp-pub
		659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92If
	</code>
</pre>

<p>you run <code>git push --tags</code>, the <b>maintainer-pgp-pub</b> tag will be shared with everyone.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to verify a tag, they can directly import your PGP key by pulling the blob directly out of the database and importing it into GPG:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git show maintainer-pgp-pub | gpg --import
	</code>
</pre>

<p>They can use that key to verify all your signed tags. Also, if you include instructions in the tag message, running <code>git show &lt;tag&gt;</code> will let you give the end user more specific instructions about tag verification.</p>

<p>If you want to have a human-readable name to go with a commit, you can run <code>git describe</code> on that commit. In response, Git generates a string consisting of the name of the most recent tag earlier than that commit, followed by the number of commits since that tag, followed finally by a partial SHA-1 value of the commit being described (prefixed with the letter "g" meaning Git):</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git describe master
		v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Now you want to release a build. One of the things you’ll want to do is create an archive of the latest snapshot of your code for those poor souls who don’t use Git. The command to do this is git archive:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="3" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git archive master --prefix='project/' | gzip > `git describe master`.tar.gz
		ls *.tar.gz
		v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c.tar.gz
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If someone opens that <b>tarball</b>, they get the latest snapshot of your project under a project directory. You can also create a zip archive in much the same way, but by passing the <code>--format=zip</code> option to <code>git archive</code>:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-6" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git archive master --prefix='project/' --format=zip > `git describe master`.zip
	</code>
</pre>

<p>A nice way of quickly getting a sort of changelog of what has been added to your project since your last release or email is to use the <code>git shortlog</code> command. It summarizes all the commits in the range you give it; for example, the following gives you a summary of all the commits since your last release, if your last release was named <b>v1.0.1</b>:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		git shortlog --no-merges master --not v1.0.1
	</code>
</pre>

<p>You get a clean summary of all the commits since <b>v1.0.1</b>, grouped by author, that you can email to your list.</p>
