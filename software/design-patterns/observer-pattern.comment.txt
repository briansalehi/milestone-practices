The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so
that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and
updated automatically.

<h4>Design Principle</h4>
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but they typically
have very little knowledge of each other. Loosely coupled designs often give
us a lot of flexibility. And as it turns out, the Observer Pattern is a great
example of loose coupling.

Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can
handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
