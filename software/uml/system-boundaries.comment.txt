To show your system's boundary on a use case diagram, draw a box around all of
the use cases but keep the actors outside of the box.

Use Case Overview diagrams give you an opportunity to paint a broad picture of
your system's context or domain.

Use cases show what your system should do.
Activity diagrams allow you to
specify how your system will accomplish its goals.
