A communication line connects an actor and a use case to show the actor
participating in the use case.

There is no theoretical limit to the number of actors that can participate in
a use case.

The purpose of a communication line is to show that an actor is simply
involved in a use case, not to imply an information exchange in any particular
direction or that the actor starts the use case.
That type of information is contained within a use case's detailed
description, therefore it doesn't make sense to apply navigation to
communication lines.
