**std::set_union** function concatenates two container members and places
the resulting container into fifth parameter which is an output iterator.  
Problem rises when we what to use *container.begin()* at the fifth parameter
as an output iterator.
two reasons make this not to work:

* begin() returns a constant key, and cannot be used as an output iterator
* begin() cannot be used directly becase *set_union* overwrites existing data in a container
and requires the container to have sufficient space to hold the new information.
**std::insert_iterator** solves this problem by allocating new space to hold new data.
iterators are discussed later in iterators chapter.
