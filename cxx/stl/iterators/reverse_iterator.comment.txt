You have two approaches to iterate over a container in reverse order.  
One to use **rbegin()** iterator which points to **end()**,
and **rend()** which points to **begin()** which is first member. 
One problem using this method is that rend points to nothing! that is,
it points to the last member of container but that member does not hold
any value.  
Second approach is to use **std::reverse\_iterator** that does it for you.
