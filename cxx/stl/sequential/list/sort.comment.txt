There are some methods like **sort()** or **transport()** and other algorithmic functions, that might need you to create a function or object function (will be discussed later) to complete the task of it.  
Imagine you want to sort a container, containing elements of type a special object you have created earlier. How the sort function should know how to sort this container? You decide! You create a predicate function (disscussed later) to complete the action based on a rational way of comparison used to sort your objects.
