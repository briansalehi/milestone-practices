You can have random access to data of a file using **seekg()** for input file (seek get),
and **seekp()** function for output file (seek put).  
Both functions get parameter type of **std::streampos** class.  
To calculate the position of a data, you must multiply a type of *long* to the sizeof single data
written in that file. That is, working file must contain a sequence of similar data type.
