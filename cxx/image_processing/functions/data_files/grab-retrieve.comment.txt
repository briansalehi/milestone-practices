**BUGGY**: needs to be fixed, cv::VideoCapture::retrieve() won't retrieve next
frame as loop iterates.

The **cv::VideoCapture::grab()** function copies the currently available image
to an internal buffer that is invisible to the user.

```cxx
bool cv::VideoCapture::grab();
```

As was the case with **cv::VideoCapture::read()**, **cv::VideoCapture::grab()**
returns true only if the grab was successful.

**cv::VideoCapture::retrieve()** functions analogously to
**cv::VideoCapture::read()** except that it operates from the internal buffer to
which **cv::VideoCapture::grab()** copies frames.

```cxx
bool cv::VideoCapture::retrieve(
	cv::OutputArray image,	// image into which to read data
	int channel = 0	// used for multihead devices like Kinect and Videre
);
```

Another difference is the additional argument **channel**. The channel argument
is used when the device being accessed natively has multiple heads.
