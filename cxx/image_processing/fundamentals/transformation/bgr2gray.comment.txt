For edge detection we use Canny edge detector function **cv::Canny()** here.  
The edge detector generates an image that is full size of the input image
but needs to be only single channel image to write to,
so we convert the input image to a gray-scale, single-channel image first,
using **cv::cvtColor()** with the flag to convert blue, green, red (BGR)
images to gray-scale, **cv::COLOR_BGR2GRAY**.
