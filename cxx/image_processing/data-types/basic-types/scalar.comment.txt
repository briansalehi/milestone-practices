**cv::Scalar** template class is a four-dimensional point class having members of double-precision floating point numbers.  
There are some function members supporting four-dimensional operations, a few of them used in this sample.  
There's no need to cast cv::Scalar to cv::Vec becuase it is directly inherited from a vector class and has all of the properties of a vector.
