You have seen these lines dozen times in previous chapters of multi-threading.  
What you need to know is that some operations like writing to output stream is not thread-safe, either in C or C++ style.  
To make a thread write in *stdout* or any other streams, output source needs to be locked for the writing thread to prevent simultaneous write operations of other threads.  
By not doing this lock actually the program will not crash but the output string will be a jumble.
