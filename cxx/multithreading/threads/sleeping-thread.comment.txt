We used **chrono** header file to access to time functions.  
There's only one extra line in this program which needs to be explained.  
**std::this_thread::sleep_for()** function gets a time object of type **std::chrono::seconds()** which specifies acurate 1 second duration to the system.  
This way we made all threads to sleep for 1 second. We need timing for future use.
