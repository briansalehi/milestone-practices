There's a way to count time during execution of program and that's using high resolution clock in **std::chrono**.  
Here we captured time value before and after **sleep_for()** function and then evaluated the elapsed time during sleeping of threads.  
To get the time difference we used **std::chrono::duration** template class initiated by **<double, std::milli>** which specifies that we need the elapsed time in milli seconds.  
Notice that to get the value of milli seconds you need to call the **count()** function on *elapsed* object.
