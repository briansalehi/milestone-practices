Abstraction is the access level to object members. Object members can be  
accessed from different scopes based on their abstraction.

ref[6]
One important feature of classes is the notion of access control. Members may  
be declared to be public, which means that they are accessible from outside the  
class, or private, which means that they are accessible only from within the class.

All external access to class objects takes place through the public members,  
or the public interface as it is called.

Note that if no access specifier is given, the default is private for classes and  
public for structures.
