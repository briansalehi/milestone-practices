There is nothing new in this code except **cv::GaussianBlur()** function
and **cv::moveWindow()**.

First, we created two image structures of type **cv::Mat**, one to open
the sample image and the other to store the blurred image in it.

Notice how we used **cv::GaussianBlur()** function, it takes the image we
give as the source and takes second argument of type **cv::Mat** as the destination
of filtered source, **cv::Size()** function as third argument to specify the size of
blocks of pixels being filtered by Gaussian convolution filter, and two constants as
forth and fifth arguments.

Then I used **cv::moveWindow()** function to move the destination image to avoid
windows overlaps.
