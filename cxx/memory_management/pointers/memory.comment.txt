Pointers are special variables holding memory addresses.  
**notice** that pointers can be declared but point to nowhere in the memory.
This can be dangerious when you want to use this pointer as your program may happen to access to an invalid memory and make your program to crash.  
Always initialize pointers after declaration or temporarily set them to **nullptr**.
This way your program can throw exception if an empty pointer was mistakenly used.
These exceptions can be handled, exceptions will be discussed later.

As pointers are themselves variables, they can point to nowhere which does not make them fool-proof. References instead, cannot point to an invalid memory address. references will be discussed soon.
