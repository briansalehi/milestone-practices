Memory addresses can be assigned to pointers either by **dereference operator &** or by allocating new memory block and assigning the address of its first by to the pointer.  
**new** operator allocates as much memory as you need by the type specifying after it.  
**always** use **delete** operator after you finish working with allocated memories used by **new**.

begin[5]
After you are finished with your dynamically allocated memory, you need to deallocate the memory
using the delete operator. To prevent the pointer from being used after having deallocated the
memory it points to, itâ€™s recommended to set your pointer to nullptr.
