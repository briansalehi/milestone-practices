The core object of the Boost::Asio namespace is io_service.
The **I/O service** is a channel that is used to access operating
system resources and establish communication between our
program and the operating system that performs I/O requests.
There is also an **I/O object** that has the role of submitting
I/O requests.
For instance, the tcp::socket object will provide a socket
programming request from our program to the operating system.
