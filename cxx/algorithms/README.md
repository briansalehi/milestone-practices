# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this section we will be using everything we have practiced so far in Cxx  
programming language and its standard template library (STL) to work with  
important and commonly used data structures and algorithms.

Practicing these pages are strongly recommended as they make your programming  
skills beyond syntax writing. Data sturctures and algorithms make you think  
better in general and make you write a clean and high performance code.

These practices are collected from the best data structures and algorithms  
references which you can find in <a href="../REFERENCES.md">REFERENCES.md</a>.
