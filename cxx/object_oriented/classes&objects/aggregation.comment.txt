You were shortly introduced to **initializer lists** previously.  
The thing is, objects can be initialized by initializer lists.  
We could initialize objects in multiple forms:  

```cxx
Aggregate1 agg1("Cxx", 11);
```

or

```cxx
Aggregate1 agg1;
agg1.name = "Cxx";
agg1.number = 11;
```

But using **initializer lists** we simply put all of the values of different types in one box and set them to an object.
