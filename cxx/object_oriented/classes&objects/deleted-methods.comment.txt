To prevent an object from being assigned to another object, copy constructor
and assignment operator should be put in private section.  
Another way of doing that is to explicitely use **delete** keyword to
declare that specified function is deleted.  
Deleted functions are declared and are known to the functions stack, but they
cannot be used.
