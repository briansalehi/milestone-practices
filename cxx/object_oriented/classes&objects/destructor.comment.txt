Destructors are invoked just before the object is completely destroyed.  
Constructors and destructors are great places to allocate memory right after object creation and delete just before object destruction.

ref[6]
A constructor is called when a class object comes into existence. A destructor is  
a member function that is automatically called when a class object ceases to exist.
