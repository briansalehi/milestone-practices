Constructors are the methods in classes having the same name of the class.
They are invoked right after an object is created.
Either they can have arguments or not.

Constructors have no return value.

ref[6]
An important aspect of classes is the capability to initialize a classâ€™s  
member data. A constructor is a special member function whose task is to  
perform such an initialization. It is invoked when a new class object comes  
into existence. There is an analogous destructor member function that is  
called when a class object goes out of existence.
