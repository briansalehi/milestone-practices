**Variadic Templates** are a way to support dynamic parameter length.  
Meaning that a function can have 2, 3 or more parameters each time we call it.  
There are two parts of a variadic template, one accepts multiple parameters and another only accepts two parameters. the execution will reach to second one when there are no more parameters to parse.
