Imagine the hierarchy of inheriting classes look like a diamond.  

```txt
    Top  
Middle1 Middle2 Middle3  
    Bottom
```

When we create this structure and inherit those classes as usual,
We will see that for each Middle class there will be an invokation of Top class.
That is, Top class's constructor will be called 3 times here.  
This is called the **Diamond Problem** and we fix this problem by virtually inheriting Top class.
