Programmers are often asked to describe algorithms in a way that is intended for
human eyes only, prior to writing actual code. Such descriptions are called pseudo-code.
Pseudo-code is not a computer program, but is more structured than usual
prose. Pseudo-code is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming
constructs that describe the main ideas behind a generic implementation of a data
structure or algorithm. There really is no precise definition of the pseudo-code
language, however, because of its reliance on natural language. At the same time, to
help achieve clarity, pseudo-code mixes natural language with standard programming language constructs.

When we write pseudo-code, we must keep in mind that we are writing for a
human reader, not a computer. Thus, we should strive to communicate high-level
ideas, not low-level implementation details. At the same time, we should not gloss
over important steps. Like many forms of human communication, finding the right
balance is an important skill that is refined through practice.
