Variable types can be casted to type of another,
but you must be careful when you do it.  
Suppose you have a type of **double**,
you must not cast it to type **int** as its last 4 bytes will get lost!

ref[6]
Static casting is used when a conversion is made between two related types, for  
example numbers to numbers or pointers to pointers.

The most common use is for conversions between numeric types. Some of these  
conversions may involve the loss of information, for example a conversion from  
a **double** to an **int**. This conversion is done by truncating the fractional  
part (not rounding).

This type of casting is more verbose than the C-style and functional-style casts  
shown earlier. But this form is appropriate, because it serves as a visible warning to  
the programmer that a potentially unsafe operation is taking place.

Some older C++ compilers may not support the newer cast operators,  
but then the traditional C-style and functional-style casts can be used instead.
