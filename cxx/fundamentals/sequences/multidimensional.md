# 01.04.03 multidimentional array

```cxx
int main()
{
    // 2D array, also can be initialized {1,2,3,4,5,6}, because memory is 1D
    int dual[2][2] = {{1,2}, {3,4}};

    return 0;
}

```

What you need to know about the multi-dimensional arrays is that are not really
multi-dimensional! that is, our systems are running on an one dimensional memory.  
All dimensions of an array are held on a line of memory, so you can initialize
an array in one dimension and use it multi-dimensional later on.
