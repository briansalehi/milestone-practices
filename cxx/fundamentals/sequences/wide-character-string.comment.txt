wide characters, 16 bit and 32 bit characters can be used in programs which may use non-English characters like Japanese.

raw strings can be used for ease of writing escape characters in strings by starting strings by 'R' character like:

    R"(string with escape characters like \n)"

or use custom delimiters:

    R"+*(string with escape characters)+*"

other ways, you should escape each special character in string (don't!)
