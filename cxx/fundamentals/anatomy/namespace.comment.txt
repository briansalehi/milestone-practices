Global variables present many problems in large software systems because they
can be accessed and possibly modified anywhere in the program.
They also can lead to programming errors, since an important global variable
may be hidden by a local variable of the same name.
As a result, it is best to avoid global variables.
We may not be able to avoid globals entirely, however.

A namespace is a mechanism that allows a group of related names to be defined
in one place.
This helps organize global objects into natural groups and minimizes the
problems of globals.

I believe namespaces are better mentioned than being used. that is, don't use
<b>using namespace std</b>, instead, mention them like <b>std::cout</b>.
In large code bases, namespaces can colide and make great confusion.  
Though, this is totally optional for you and it's my personal approach in
coding not a best practice.
