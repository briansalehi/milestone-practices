Considering the design of a clean code, a function should not have more than
two arguments, at most three.  
What you usually try to give to a function can be put in a larger structure.  
Say, you want to give a function three variables: book_title, book_pages, book_price  

```cxx
void function(const char* book_title, int book_pages, int book_price);
```

Instead, you can create a structure named **book** containing:  

```cxx
struct class Book {
    char* title;
    int pages;
    int price;
} book;
```

And call the function with one argument:

```cxx
void function(const Book book) {
    // do something with book.title, book.pages, book.price
}
```
