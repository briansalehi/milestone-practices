Like many programming languages, creating and running a C++ program requires
several steps.
First, we create a C++ source file into which we enter the lines of our
program.
After we save this file, we then run a program, called a compiler, which
generates a machine-code interpretation of this program.
Another program, called a linker (which is typically invoked automatically by
the compiler), includes any required library code functions needed and
produces the final machine-executable file.
