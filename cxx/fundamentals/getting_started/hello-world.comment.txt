This is a C++ program sample.

C++ joins three separate programming categories:  

<ul>
<li>the procedural language: represented by C</li>
<li>the object-oriented language: represented by the class enhancements C++
adds to C</li>
<li>generic programming: supported by C++ templates</li>
</ul>

So, C++ <b>is</b> a generic programming language.

Compilation process is done in the following steps:

<ul>
<li><b>source code</b>: the language syntax we deal with, and what we have to
write in one or more source files with .cxx or .cpp extension</li>
<li><b>compiler</b>: a step that compiler reads our source files and converts
them into machine language, normally a tool like g++ called as a command</li>
<li><b>object code</b>: files written in machine code, generated by compilers,
and ready to be linked together or with shared libraries</li>
<li><b>linker</b>: a tool which links all object codes together or with shared
libraries in a system dynamically or statically</li>
<li><b>executable code</b>: a completely machine comprehensive file ready to
be executed on a system</li>
</ul>
