in previous practice, enumeration was introduced by class expression, though, inherited by C,
in C++ enumerations can also be declared by only **enum** keyword.  
Though, there is a big difference between **enum** and **enum class** declared enumerations.
enumeration members defined by **enum** are visible globally, but enumberation members defined
by **enum class** are scoped (next practice) and their scope must be specified before use.  
Generally, it's best practice to avoid globals.
