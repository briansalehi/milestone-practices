**Notice**: output values might differ on your system.

You need to remember that **sizeof()** is an operator, not a function.  
The amount of memory *sizeof()* operator represents does not depend on the value held by a variable,
but it depends on the operating system which you are using.  
Some systems will use int as a 8 byte memory block and some might use 4 bytes so as my system.
