**auto** type is a way to let compiler deduce a type and replace it in compile type.  
using auto type will make your code a lot easier and shorter, specially when it comes to
iterators, which will be discussed later.

Just like anything in your daily life, type **auto** has its cons too.  
Your code might look easier to read by using type **auto**, but be aware that
using too many *auto* types will make types hard to guess and soon your program will look confusing,
as all types are no longer explicitely visible!

Personally, I always prefer using explicit types, even if they make my code longer and harder to read,
at least I won't end up guessing my variable types. But it's just a matter of taste.
