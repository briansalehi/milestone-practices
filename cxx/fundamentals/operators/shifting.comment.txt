If you have trouble understanding logical operations, then you need to study **set theory** on the internet.  
It is not a big deal, all you need to do is to know how binary numbers work.

Do not get confused by shift operator << and >> with insert operation to std::cout << and std::cin >>.  
They are so different and each of them do something differently.
