This section illustrates the most basic building blocks of a
C++ programing language.

C++ joins three separate programming categories:  

<ul>
<li>The procedural language: represented by C</li>
<li>The object-oriented language: represented by the class enhancements C++
adds to C</li>
<li>Generic programming: supported by C++ templates</li>
</ul>

So, C++ <b>is</b> a <b>generic programming language</b>.
