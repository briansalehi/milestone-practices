A Crash Course in C++ and the Standard Library

Building a C++ program is a three-step process. First, the code is run through a preprocessor, which recognizes meta-information about the code. Next, the code is compiled, or translated into machine-readable object files. Finally, the individual object files are linked together into a single application.

In C, the names of the Standard Library header files usually end in .h, such as<stdio.h>, and namespaces are not used.
In C++, the .h suffix is omitted for Standard Library headers, such as<iostream>, and everything is defined in thestdnamespace or a sub-namespace ofstd.

The new and recommended versions without a .h suffix but with a c prefix. These versions put everything in the std namespace (for example, <cstdio>).

The old versions with the .h suffix. These versions do not use namespaces (for example, <stdio.h>).

The following table shows some of the most common preprocessor directives.

#include [file]

Almost always used to include header files so that code can

#define [key] [value]

Often used in C to define a constant value or a macro. C++ provides better mechanisms for constants and most types of macros. Macros can be dangerous, so use them cautiously.

Used most frequently to protect against circular includes.

#ifdef [key]
#endif
#ifndef [key]
#endif

#pragma [xyz]

xyz is compiler dependent. It often allows the programmer to display a warning or error if the directive is reached during preprocessing.

One example of using preprocessor directives is to avoid multiple includes, as shown here: 
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H
// … the contents of this header file
#endif

If your compiler supports the #pragma once directive, and most modern compilers do, then this can be rewritten as follows: 
#pragma once

Never put ausingdirective orusingdeclaration in a header file; otherwise, you force it on everyone who is including your header file.

A nested namespace is a namespace inside another one.

namespace MyLibraries {
    namespace Networking {
        namespace FTP {
            /* … */
        }
    }
}
This can be simplified a lot with C++17: 
namespace MyLibraries::Networking::FTP {
    /* … */
}

}
A namespace alias can be used to give a new and possibly shorter name to another namespace. For example: namespace MyFTP = MyLibraries::Networking::FTP;

Literals are used to write numbers or strings in your code. C++ supports a number of standard literals.

Decimal literal, 123

Octal literal, 0173

Hexadecimal literal, 0x7B

Binary literal, 0b1111011

A floating-point value (such as 3.14f)

A double floating-point value (such as 3.14)

A single character (such as 'a')

A zero-terminated array of characters (such as "character array")

It is also possible to define your own type of literals

Digits separators can be used in numeric literals. A digits separator is a single quote character. For example, 
23'456'789
0.123'456f

C++17 adds support for hexadecimal floating-point literals—for example, 0x3.ABCp-10, 0Xb.cp12l.

The following table shows the most common types used in C++.

The switch statement is an alternate syntax for performing actions based on the value of an expression. In C++, the expression of a switch statement must be of an integral type, a type convertible to an integral type, an enumerated type, or a strongly typed enumeration, and must be compared to constants.

C++ has one operator that takes three ar
guments, known as a ternary operator. It is used as a shorthand conditional expression of the form “if [something] then [perform action], otherwise [perform some other action].” The conditional operator is represented by a ? and a :. The following code outputs “yes” if the variable i is greater than 2, and “no” otherwise: 
std::cout << ((i > 2) ? "yes" : "no");
The parentheses around i > 2 are optional, so the following is equivalent: 
std::cout << (i > 2 ? "yes" : "no");

With C++14, you can ask the compiler to figure out the return type of a function automatically. To make use of this functionality, you need to specify auto as the return type: 
auto addNumbers(int number1, int number2)
{
    return number1 + number2;
}

Every function has a local predefined variable __func__ containing the name of the current function. One use of this variable would be for logging purposes: 
int addNumbers(int number1, int number2)
{
    std::cout << "Entering function " << __func__ << std::endl;
    return number1 + number2;
}

To get the size of a stack-based C-style array, you can use the C++17 std::size() function (requires <array>). For example: 
unsigned int arraySize = std::size(myArray);
I

If your compiler is not yet C++17 compliant, the old trick to get the size of a stack-based C-style array is to use the sizeof operator. The sizeof operator returns the size of its argument in bytes. To get the number of elements in a stack-based array, you divide the size in bytes of the array by the size in bytes of the first element. For example: 
unsigned int arraySize = sizeof(myArray) / sizeof(myArray[0]);

C++ has a special type of fixed-size container called std::array, defined in the <array> header file. It’s basically a thin wrapper around C-style arrays. 
There are a number of advantages to using std::arrays instead of C-style arrays. They always know their own size, are not automatically cast to a pointer to avoid certain types of bugs, and have iterators to easily loop over the elements.

The range-basedfor loop is the fourth looping mechanism. It allows for easy iteration over elements of a container. This type of loop works for C-style arrays, initializer lists (discussed later in this chapter), and any type that has begin() and end() methods returning iterators (see Chapter 17), such as std::array, std::vector, and all other Standard Library containers discussed in Chapter 17.
