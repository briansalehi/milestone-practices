Mastering the C++17 STL (2017)

Iterators and Ranges

Many of the two-range algorithms in the C++17 standard library also have variant forms colloquially known as one-and-a-half-range algorithms. For example, in addition to std::mismatch(a,b,c,d) you'll find std::mismatch(a,b,c)--the second range's "end" point is simply assumed to be at c + std::distance(a, b). If c actually points into a container where c + std::distance(a, b) would be "off the end," then, tough luck!
Because "tough luck" is never a really great answer to a technical question, the C++17 standard added safe two-range variants for many of the one-and-a-half-range algorithms that had existed in C++14.
