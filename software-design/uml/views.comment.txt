There are a number of ways to break up your UML model diagrams into
perspectives or views that capture a particular facet of your system.

The 4+1 view model breaks down a model into a set of views, each capturing a
specific aspect of your system:

<ul>
<li>Logical view</li>
Describes the abstract descriptions of a system's parts. Used to model what a
system is made up of and how the parts interact with each other. The types of
UML diagrams that typically make up this view include class, object, state
machine, and interaction diagrams.

<li>Process view</li>
Describes the processes within your system. It is particularly helpful when
visualizing what must happen within your system. This view typically contains
activity diagrams.

<li>Development view</li>
Describes how your system's parts are organized into modules and components.
It is very useful to manage layers within your system's architecture. This
view typically contains package and component diagrams.

<li>Physical view</li>
Describes how the system's design, as described in the three previous views,
is then brought to life as a set of real-world entities. The diagrams in this
view show how the abstract parts map into the final deployed system. This view
typically contains deployment diagrams.

<li>Use case view </li>
Describes the functionality of the system being modeled from the perspective
of the outside world. This view is needed to describe what the system is
supposed to do. All of the other views rely on the use case view to guide
themâ€”that's why the model is called 4+1. This view typically contains use case
diagrams, descriptions, and overview diagrams.
</ul>
