<p>Many newcomers to UML focus on the different types of diagrams used to model their system. It's very easy to assume that the set of diagrams that have been created actually are the model.</p>

<p>But UML modeling is not just about diagrams; it's about capturing your system as a model—the diagrams are actually just windows into that model.</p>

<p>A particular diagram will show you some parts of your model but not necessarily everything.</p>

<p>Well, the first thing to understand is that your model sits behind your modeling tool and diagrams as a collection of elements. Each of those elements could be a use case, a class, an activity, or any other construct that UML supports. The collection of all the elements that describe your system, including their connections to each other, make up your model.</p>

<p>up of elements, then you wouldn't have much to look at. This is where diagrams come in.</p>

<p>Rather than actually being your model, diagrams are used merely as a canvas on which you can create new elements that are then added to your model and organize related elements into a set of views on your underlying model.</p>

<p>So, when you next use your UML tool to work with a set of diagrams in UML notation, it is worth remembering that what you are manipulating is a view of the contents of your model. You can change elements of your model within the diagram, but the diagram itself is not the model—it's just a useful way of presenting some small part of the information your model contains.</p>

<p>In the following sections we are going to review UML diagrams using <a href="https://plantuml.com">PlantUML</a> tool which is a text to diagram UML tool written in Java. To use it you must already have Java installed on your system and to sketch sequence diagrams you will also need to have GraphViz installed.</p>
