<p><b>Use cases</b> allow your model to describe what your system must be able to do; <b>classes</b> allow your model to describe the different types of parts that make up your system's structure.</p>

<p>With use cases and classes alone, you can't yet model how your system is actually going to its job. This is where <b>interaction diagrams</b>, and specifically <b>sequence diagrams</b>, come into play.</p>
