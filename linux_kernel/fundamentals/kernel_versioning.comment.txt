<p>Until 2003, there was a new stable release branch of Linux every 2 or 3 years (2.0, 2.2, 2.4). New development branches took 2-3 years to become stable (too slow!).</p>

<p>Since 2003, there is a new stable release of Linux about every 10 weeks.</p>

<p>For each release, there are bugfix and security updates.</p>

![merge-and-bug-fix-window.png]

<p>Only the last release of each year is made an LTS (Long Term Support) release, and is supposed to be supported for up to 6 years.</p>

<p>The LTS versions can be captured on <a href="https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html">kernel.org</a>.</p>

<p>Example at Google: starting from Android O (2017), all new Android devices will have to run such an LTS kernel.</p>

<p>It is easy to tell if you are running a distribution kernel. Unless you downloaded, compiled and installed your own version of kernel from kernel.org, you are running a distribution kernel. To find out the version of your kernel, run <code>uname -r</code>:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-prompt="" data-user="" data-host="milestone" data-line="" data-output="2">
	<code>
		uname -r
		5.12.8-arch1-1
	</code>
</pre>
