Once you have captured an initial set of actors that interact with your
system, you can assemble the exact model of those interactions. The next step
is to find cases where the system is being used to complete a specific job for
an actor—use cases, in fact. Use cases can be identified from your user's
requirements.<br />
<br />
A use case is a case (or situation) where your system is used to fulfill one
or more of your user's requirements; a use case captures a piece of
functionality that the system provides.<br />
<br />
A use case, or job, might be as simple as allowing the user to log in or as
complex as executing a distributed transaction across multiple global
databases. The important thing to remember is that a use case—from the user's
perspective—is a complete use of the system; there is some interaction with
the system, as well as some output from that interaction. For example,
Requirement A.1 describes one main use of the CMS: to create a new blog
account. following figure shows how this interaction is captured as a use
case.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/use-case-sample.png" alt="use case sample" loading="lazy">
<br />
A use case in UML is drawn as an oval with a name that describes the
interaction that it represents.<br />
<br />
A use case is something that provides some measurable result to the user or an
external system.<br />
Any piece of system behavior that meets this simple test is likely to be a
good candidate for a use case.<br />
<br />
Use cases are an excellent starting point for just about every facet of
object-oriented system development, design, testing, and documentation.<br />
They describe a system's requirements strictly from the outside looking in;<br />
they specify the value that the system delivers to users.<br />
<br />
Because use cases are your system's functional requirements, they should be
the first serious output from your model after a project is started.<br />
<br />
Use cases specify only what your system is supposed to do, i.e., the
system's functional requirements.<br />
<br />
The terms <b>shall</b> and <b>should</b> have a special and exact meaning
when it comes to requirements.<br />
A <i>shall requirement</i> must be fulfilled; if the feature that implements
a shall requirement is not in the final system, then the system does not meet
this requirement.<br />
A <i>should requirement</i> implies that the requirement is not critical to
the system working but is still desirable.<br />
If a system's development is running into problems that will cause delivery
delays, then it's often the should requirements that are sacrificed first.<br />
<br />
If use cases are truly requirements, then they must have very clear
pass/fail criteria.<br />
<br />
There's actually no specific "best way" to start analyzing requirements,
but one useful first step is to look at the things that interact with your
system. In use cases, these external things are called <a href="/software-design/uml/actors">actors</a>.<br />
<br />
A communication line connects an actor and a use case to show the actor
participating in the use case. In this example, the Administrator actor is
involved in the creation of a new blog account use case.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/communication-line-sample.png" alt="communication line sample" loading="lazy">
<br />
There is potential to have any number of actors involved in a use case. There
is no theoretical limit to the number of actors that can participate in a use
case.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/multiple-actors.png" alt="multiple actors" loading="lazy">
<br />
<h4>System Boundaries</h4>
<br />
Although there is an implicit separation between actors (external to your
system) and use cases (internal to your system) that marks your system's
boundary, UML does provide another small piece of notation if you want to make
things crystal clear.<br />
To show your system's boundary on a use case diagram, draw a box around all of
the use cases but keep the actors outside of the box. It's also good practice
to name your box after the system you are developing, as shown for the CMS in
following figure.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/system-boundaries.png" alt="system boundaries" loading="lazy">
<br />
<h4>Use Case Description</h4>
<br />
A diagram showing your use cases and actors may be a nice starting point, but
it does not provide enough detail for your system designers to actually
understand exactly how the system's concerns will be met. How can a system
designer understand who the most important actor is from the use case notation
alone? What steps are involved in the use case? The best way to express this
important information is in the form of a text-based description—every use
case should be accompanied by one.<br />
<br />
<table class="table table-dark">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">#</th>
<th scope="col">Use case description detail</th>
<th scope="col">What the detail means and why is it useful?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="row">1</th>
<td>Related Requirements</td>
<td>Some indication as to which requirements this use case partially or
completely fulfills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">2</th>

important.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">4</th>

successully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">5</th>

execute successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">6</th>

<td>The main actors that participate in the use case. Often includes the
actors that trigger or directly receive information from a use case's
execution.</td>
</tr>

execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">8</th>

<td>The event triggered by an actor that causes the use case to execute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">9</th>
<td>Main Flow</td>
<td>The place to describe each of the important steps in use case's
normal execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">10</th>

The &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; relationship declares that the use case at the head of the
dotted arrow completely reuses all of the steps from the use case being
included. In the following figure, the Create a new Blog Account and Create a
new Personal Wiki completely reuse all of the steps declared in the Check
Identity use case.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/include-relationship.png" alt="include relationship" loading="lazy">
<br />
<h4>Inheritance (Specialized Use Case)</h4>
<br />
Currently, the Content Management System contains a single Create a new Blog
Account use case that describes the steps required to create an account. But
what if the CMS supports several different types of blog accounts, and the
steps required to create each of these accounts differs ever so slightly from
the original use case? You want to describe the general behavior for creating
a blog account—captured in the Create a new Blog Account use case—and then
define specialized use cases in which the account being created is a specific
type, such as a regular account with one blog or an editorial account that can
make changes to entries in a set of blogs.<br />
<br />
This is where use case generalization comes in. A more common way of referring
to generalization is using the term inheritance . Use case inheritance is
useful when you want to show that one use case is a special type of another
use case. To show use case inheritance , use the generalization arrow to
connect the more general, or parent, use case to the more specific use case.<br />
The following figure shows how you could extend the CMS's use cases to show
that two different types of blog accounts can be created.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/specialized-use-case.png" alt="specialized use case" loading="lazy">
<br />
But be careful—by using inheritance, you are effectively saying that every
step in the general use case must occur in the specialized use cases. Also,
every relationship that the general use case has with external actors or use
cases, as shown with the &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; relationship between Create a new Blog
Account and Check Identity, must also make sense in the more specialized use
cases, such as Create a new Editorial Blog Account.<br />
<br />
If you really don't want your more specific use case to do everything that the
general use case describes, then don't use generalization. Instead, you might
want to consider using either the &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; relationship shown in the
previous section or the &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; relationship coming up in the next
section.<br />
<br />
Following figure shows you how &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; works.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/extend-relationship.png" alt="extend relationship" loading="lazy">
<br />
The designers of UML 2.0 took a very different view as to the meaning of
&lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; between use cases. They wanted a means for you to show that a use
case might completely reuse another use case's behavior, similar to the
&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; relationship, but that this reuse was optional and dependent
either on a runtime or system implementation decision.<br />
<br />
The &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; relationship is ideal in this sort of reuse situation, as shown
in the following figure.<br />
<br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="/software-design/uml/extend-example-in-diagram.png" alt="extend example in diagram" loading="lazy">
<br />
<h4>Use Case Overview</h4>
<br />
When you are trying to understand a system, it is sometimes useful to get a
glimpse of the context within which it sits. For this purpose, UML provides
the Use Case Overview diagram. Use Case Overview diagrams give you an
opportunity to paint a broad picture of your system's context or domain.<br />
