<p>SQL is a freeform language. That means that you can include line breaks, spaces, and indentation without affecting the way the database interprets the code.</p>

<p>In addition, SQL isn't case-sensitive. That means that you can use uppercase or lowercase or combination of both without affecting the way the database interprets the code.</p>

<h4>Coding Recommendations</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Capitalize all keywords, and use lowercase for the other code in a SQL statement.</li>
	<li>Separate the words in names with underscores, as in invoice_number.</li>
	<li>Start each clause on a new line.</li>
	<li>Break long clauses into multiple lines and indent continued lines.</li>
	<li>Use <i>comments</i> only for portions of code that are difficult to understand. Then, make sure that the comments are correct and up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
