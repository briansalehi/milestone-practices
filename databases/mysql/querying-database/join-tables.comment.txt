Following sample presents a SELECT statement that retrieves data from two
tables. This type of operation is called <i>join</i> because the data from the
two tables is joined together into a single result set.

An <i>inner join</i> is the most common type of join. By using an inner join,
rows from the two tables in the join are included in the result set only if
their related columns match.

Although this sample uses only how to join data from two tables, you can
extend this syntax to join data from three or more tables.

In addition to inner joins, most relational databases including MYSQL support
other types of joins such as <i>outer joins</i>. An outer join lets you
include all rows from a table even if the other table doesn't have a matching
row. You'll learn more about different types of joins in
<a href="/linux-administration/mysql/joins/">joins chapter</a>.
