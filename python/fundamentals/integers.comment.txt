Numbers are used quite often in programming to keep score in games, represent
data in visualizations, store information in web applications, and so on.
Python treats numbers in several different ways, depending on how they are
being used.

You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.

In a terminal session, Python simply returns the result of the operation.

Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents.

Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple
operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order
of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order you
specify.
