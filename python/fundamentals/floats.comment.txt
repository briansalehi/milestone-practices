Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in
most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can
appear at any position in a number.

Python 2 returns a slightly different result when you divide two integers like
3 / 2.

Instead of 1.5, Python returns 1. Division of integers in Python 2 results in
an integer with the remainder truncated. Note that the result is not a rounded
integer; the remainder is simply omitted.

To avoid this behavior in Python 2, make sure that at least one of the numbers
is a float.
