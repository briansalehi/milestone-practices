Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can
start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.

Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to
separate words in variable names.

Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.

Variable names should be short but descriptive.

Many programming errors are simple, single-character typos in one line of a
program. If you’re spending a long time searching for one of these errors,
know that you’re in good company. Many experienced and talented programmers
spend hours hunting down these kinds of tiny errors. Try to laugh about it and
move on, knowing it will happen frequently throughout your programming life.
