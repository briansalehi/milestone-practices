String is a sequence.
Sequences maintain a left-to-right order among the items they contain.
Their items are stored and fetched by their relative positions.
Strictly speaking, strings are sequences of one-character strings.
Other more general sequence types include <i>lists</i> and
<i>tuples</i>, covered in later chapters.

As sequences, strings support operations that assume a positional ordering
among items.

In Python, we can index backwards from the end using a negative index.
Formally, a negative index is simply added to the string's length, but two
operations are equivalent.

Slicing is a way to extract an entire section in a single step.
To copy an entire string, use colon character as index.

As sequences, strins also support <i>concatenation</i> with the plus sign
(joining two strings into a new string) and <i>repetition</i> (making a new
string by repeating another).

Strings are immutable and their items cannot be changed.
