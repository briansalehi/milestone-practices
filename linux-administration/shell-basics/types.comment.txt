<p>The <b>Bash</b> we use is a shell and is just a program that provies us an environment to execute commands on a system. Some commands are <b>built-in</b> and they come with the shell program itself, which are internal commands. <code>cd</code> and <code>pwd</code> are two best known internal commands.</p>

<p>Other commands are said to be <b>external commands</b>. That is, they are programs sitting somewhere and as we type their name on the shell and then hit enter the shell executes them and they can run separately from the shell itself.</p>

<p>So, <code>mkdir</code> is a program separate from the shell sitting in the <code>/usr/bin/</code> (pronounced slash USR slash BIN) directory. As we type <code>mkdir</code> on the shell, shell will find this command in its corresponding directory and execute it.</p>

<p>How does shell know where to find external programs like <code>mkdir</code> to execute them? We will see later that Bash holds a few environment variables which hold values to manage programs with. <code>PATH</code> variables is one of the environment variables which contains a list of directories separated by colon, each represent a directory which contains executable files, runnable as commands.</p>
