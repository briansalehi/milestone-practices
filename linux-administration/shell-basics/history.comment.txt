<p>Normally, your shell keeps a history of the previous commands you executed. You can access to this history by <code>history</code> command.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		history
	</code>
</pre>

<p>You can run previous command by <code>!!</code> which first indicates the command, then its results.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		!!
	</code>
</pre>

<p>You can also specifically choose a command in history and run again by its ID.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		!32
	</code>
</pre>

<p>And finally, you can clear shell history by <code>-c</code> option.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		history -c
	</code>
</pre>

<p>For security reasons, you might want to frequently do that. One reason to do this is that you may have typed a passphrase or a sensitive information in command line and now itâ€™s stored in shell history.</p>
