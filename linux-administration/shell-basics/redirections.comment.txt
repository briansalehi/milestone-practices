Redirections can be used to write a command's output to a file, e.g. create a
log file.

Right shift can be used to write to file.

Double right shift is used to append output to file.

Left shift is used to input file contents in standard input.

Double left shift is only used when a special word, usually EOF is typed
afterward, when typed so, standard input will read until it's caught EOF.

Triple left shift is used to write command's output to standard input.

Pipe is used to write left hand command's output to right hand's standard
input.
