<p>Commands can get options or arguments in front of their name:</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		command --option argument1 argument2
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Most commands accept options both in short and long form, having single and double dash respectively. Though this is conventional, donâ€™t rely on it.</p>

<p>A good first command to try, <code>uname</code>, will show what operating system is being run. That does not represent much information unless we track on the <code>-a</code> option to the command.</p>
