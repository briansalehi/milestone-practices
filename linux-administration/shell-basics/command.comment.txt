A good first command to try, <i>uname</i>, will show what operating system is
being run.
That does not represent much information unless we track on the -a option to
the command.

Commands can get options or arguments in front of their name:
$ command -option argument1 argument2

Most commands accept options both in short and long form, having single and
double dash respectively. Though this is conventional, donâ€™t rely on it.
