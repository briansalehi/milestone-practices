<p>There are so many commands each having many options in the shell. How can we manage?</p>

<p>There are a few ways we can get help when we need to know about a command or we are looking for a command to do what we want. <b>Manual pages</b> are widely used in Linux shells to give you information about the available commands. To get help of manual pages just type <code>man</code> command with the investigating command in front.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		man command
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Sometimes the command names themselve are forgotten. In this case, description or closes match to what that command is can be queried by <code>man</code> with a <code>-k</code> option.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		man -k pager
	</code>
</pre>

<p>We can see that we were looking for a pager and it introduced us the <code>pager</code> command which we call it <b>less</b>.</p>

<p>There is also another tool for reading manuals, <code>info</code>. Though, man pages are mostly used, <code>info</code> command is also pretty popular and thereâ€™s a chance you need to work with it later.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milestone">
	<code>
		info less
	</code>
</pre>
