<p>A <b>shell</b> is a program that accepts and interprets text-mode commands and provides an interface to the system.</p>

<p>Linux provides a range of available shells but we only use <b>Bash</b> in practices.</p>

<p>Linux shell use is fairly straightforward, you type a command, possibly including options to it, and the computer executes the command. For the most part, Linux commands are external. That is, they’re programs that are separate from the shell. A few commands are internal to the shell though, and they come with the shell itself, and knowing the distinction can be important.</p>

<p>If you log into Linux using a text-mode login screen, you have logged into a virtual console terminal and, most likely, you’ll be dropped directly into your default shell. If you logged into Linux using a graphical user interface (GUI) login screen, you’ll have to start a terminal emulator manually in order to reach your default shell.</p>

<p>Once we type a command and hit the enter key, we execute that command on the shell. Shell is case-sensitive, and is sensitive about spaces too. Using a space less or more can make your shell misbehave.</p>
