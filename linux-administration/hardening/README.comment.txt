<p>First, there are quite a few websites that specialize in network security news. Examples include <a href="https://packetstormsecurity.com/">Packet Storm Security</a> and <a href="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</a>. Regular tech news sites and Linux news websites, such as Ars Technica, Fudzilla, The Register, ZDNet, and LXer, also carry reports about network security breaches. And, if you'd rather watch videos than read, you'll find plenty of good YouTube channels, such as BeginLinux Guru.</p>

<p>Finally, regardless of which Linux distribution you're using, be sure to keep up with the news and current documentation for your Linux distribution. Distribution maintainers should have a way of letting you know if a security problem crops up in their products.</p>

<p>Spend some time perusing the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database, and you'll soon see why it's so important to keep your systems updated.</p>
