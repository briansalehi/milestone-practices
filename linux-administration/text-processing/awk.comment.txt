Awk is a strong text processing programmng language which deserves its own
chapter, or maybe books!
To learn Awk in depth, visit <a href="/stream-processing/awk">Awk chapter</a>.

Covering everything about Awk in a single page is impossible!
So a brief overview of Awk is that it keeps track of line and word numbers.
We can easily manipulate text, select lines and fields to print.

In this sample, the easiest task for Awk is represented which selects the
second line and third field within that line to print.

Using Awk is straightforward, you give options to <i>awk</i> and then begin
writing Awk scripts surrounded by single quotes.

<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
awk [options] 'scripts'
</code>
</pre>

In Awk, <b>NR</b> stands for <b>N</b>umber of <b>R</b>ecord which keeps
track of the line Awk is holding in its buffer to process.

<b>NF</b> stands for <b>N</b>umber of <b>F</b>ield which is self explanatory.
To print the second field though, we used <i>print $2</i> command in awk
script.

<b>FS</b> stands for <b>F</b>ield <b>S</b>eparator which Awk uses to devide
fields within a line to process.
<i>FS</i> can also be given by -F option.

Here we have set FS="," variable to separate fields within lines and NF=3 to
select the third field in NR=2 second line.
