<p>Sed is a stream processing tool which has its own reputation and we will not cover everything about it (we can't) in a single practice.</p>

<p>To learn <code>sed</code> in depth, visit <a href="/linux-administration/stream-processing/sed">stream processing</a> chapter.</p>

<p>We will cover the most basic and regularly used features of <code>sed</code> here, which are deleting and printing lines, and also substitution of strings.</p>

<p>Using <code>sed</code> is straightforward, you call <code>sed</code> following options and then <b>sed</b> script surrounded by single quotes. The <b>sed</b> script itself follows a specific syntax, first the address of lines can be given by numbers or string pattern, then a command is followed by that address to give desired results.</p>

<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-user="user" data-host="milsetone" data-output="">
	<code>
		sed options '/address/command'
	</code>
</pre>

<p>In case of addess, we are using line numbers in this example. And for commands, we used <code>d</code> to delete mentioned lines. We used <code>p</code> to print specified lines, which requires <code>-n</code> to avoid duplicate printing of lines, simply because sed itself also prints lines alongside our print command. And then we used <code>s</code> to substitute word <i>amazing</i> to <i>useful</i>.</p>
