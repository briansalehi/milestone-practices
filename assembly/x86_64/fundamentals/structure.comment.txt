In section <b>.data</b> , initialized data is declared and defined, in the
following format:

<b>&lt;variable name&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;value&gt;</b>

Variable names start with a letter, followed by letters or numbers or
special characters.

When a variable is included in <i>section .data</i>, memory is allocated
for that variable when the source code is assembled and linked to an
executable.

<i>section .data</i> can also contain constants, which are values that
cannot be changed in the program. They are declared in the following format:

<b>&lt;constant name&gt; equ &lt;value&gt;</b>

<table class="table table-dark">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">#</th>
      <th scope="col">Type</th>
      <th scope="col">Length</th>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>db</td>
      <td>8 bits</td>
      <td>Byte</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>dw</td>
      <td>16 bits</td>
      <td>Word</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>dd</td>
      <td>32 bits</td>
      <td>Double word</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>dq</td>
      <td>64 bits</td>
      <td>Quadword</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

The acronym bss stands for Block Started by Symbol , and its history goes
back to the fifties, when it was part of assembly language developed for the
IBM 704. In this section go the uninitialized variables. Space for uninitialized
variables is declared in this section, in the following format:

<b>&lt;variable name&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;number&gt;</b>

<table class="table table-dark">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">#</th>
      <th scope="col">Type</th>
      <th scope="col">Length</th>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>sesb</td>
      <td>8 bits</td>
      <td>Byte</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>resw</td>
      <td>16 bits</td>
      <td>Word</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>resd</td>
      <td>32 bits</td>
      <td>Double word</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>resq</td>
      <td>64 bits</td>
      <td>Quadword</td>
    </tr>

The variables in <i>section .bss</i> do not contain any values; the values
will be assigned later at execution time.
Memory places are not reserved at compile time but at execution time.

When your program starts executing, the program asks
for the needed memory from the operating system, allocated to variables in
section .bss and initialized to zeros.
If there is not enough memory
available for the .bss variables at execution time, the program will crash.

<i>section .txt</i> is where all the action is.
This section contains the program code and starts with the following:

<pre language="nasm">
	<code>
		global main
		main:
	</code>
</pre>

The <b>main:</b> part is called a label.
Registers such as rdi, rsi, and rax are prepared for outputting a message on
the screen.

Here, we will display a
string on the screen using a system call. That is, we will ask the operating
system to do the work for us.

System calls are used to ask the operating system to do specific actions.
Every operating system has a different list of system call parameters, and the
system calls for Linux are different from Windows or macOS.
We use the Linux system calls for x64 in these series of practices.

Be aware that 32-bit system calls differ from 64-bit system calls.
