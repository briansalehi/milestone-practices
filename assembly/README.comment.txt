<p>Learning assembly has several benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You’ll learn how a CPU and memory works.</li>
	<li>You’ll learn how a computer and operating system work together.</li>
	<li>You’ll learn how high-level language compilers generate machine language, and that knowledge can help you to write more efficient code.</li>
	<li>You will be better equipped to analyze bugs in your programs.</li>
	<li>It is a lot of fun when you eventually get your program working.</li>
	<li>And if you want to investigate malware, you have only the machine code, not the source code. With an understanding of assembly language, you will be able to analyze malware and take necessary actions and precautions.</li>
</ul>
