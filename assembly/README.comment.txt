This section contains Assembly practices.

Assembly is not a cross-platform language, nor it has one general syntax for
all platforms.
Therefore, this section holds different Assembly languages each for a specific
platform.
Most of these Assembly languages need their own cross-compilation tools in
order to compile them.
