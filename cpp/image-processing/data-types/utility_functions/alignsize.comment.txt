Given a number *n* (typically a return value from *sizeof()*), and a size for a buffer,
**cv::alignSize()** computes the size that this buffer should be in order to contain an integer number of objects of size *n*.
That is, the minimum number that is greater or equal to buffer size yet divisable by *n*.
The following formula is used:

```cxx
(bs + n-1) & -n
```
