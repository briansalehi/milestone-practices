Of OpenCV basic types, point classes are the simplest template classes.  
There are two and three dimensional point templates.  
Point classes are instantiated with aliases of having specific types and dimensions.  
Such aliases are: **cv::Point{2,3}{b,w,s,i,d,f}**  
Samples:

* cv::Point2i
* cv::Point2f
* cv::Point3d
