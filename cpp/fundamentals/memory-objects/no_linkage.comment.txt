<p>Variables declare within the blocks using <code>static</code> keyword, are only accessible in that block, though they exist in memory during the program's lifetime. <b>Static</b> variables with <b>no linkage</b> can be used to store informations of a function that should still exist even when that function is not initialized. Counting how many times a function has been called can be a good example.</p>
