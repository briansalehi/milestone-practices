<p>C++14 adds support for chunking separators in the form of a single quotation mark. This improves readability of code, as seen in the following initializations:</p>

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		int moneyInBank = -70'000; // -70000
		long populationChange = -85'000; // -85000
		long long countryGDPChange = -70'000'000'000; // -70 billion
		double pi = 3.141'592'653'59; // 3.14159265359
	</code>
</pre>

<p>There are a few different constants in C++ which numbers, raw strings (string literals) are one of those constants called <b>literals</b>. Literals are R-values and have no memory address.</p>
