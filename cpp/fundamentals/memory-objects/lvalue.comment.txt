<p><b>L-values</b> often refer to locations in memory. A variable such as <code>daysInYear</code> in the following example is actually a handle to a memory location and is an <b>l-value</b>. <b>R-values</b>, on the other hand, can be the very content of a memory location.</p>

<p>So, all l-values can be r-values, but not all r-values can be l-values. To understand it  better, look at the following example, which doesn’t make any sense and therefore won’t compile:</p>

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		365 = daysInYear;
	</code>
</pre>
