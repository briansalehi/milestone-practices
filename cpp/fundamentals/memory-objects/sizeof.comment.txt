<p><b>Notice</b>: output values might differ on your system.</p>

<p>You need to remember that <code>sizeof()</code> is an operator, not a function. The amount of memory <code>sizeof()</code> operator represents does not depend on the value held by a variable, but it depends on the operating system which you are using. Some systems will use int as a 8 byte memory block and some might use 4 bytes so as my system.</p>
