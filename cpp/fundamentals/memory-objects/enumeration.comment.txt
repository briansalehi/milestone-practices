<p><b>Enumerations</b> are one of the constant types in C++.</p>  

<p>When dealing with kind of data holding only a specific possible amount of values, you should use enumeration. As an example, a traffic control has only 3 light colors, so to prevent the possibility of adding another color to this range, we use an enumeration.</p>

<p>Though, an enumeration is declared by integers, its elements are not of type int and they should not be compared by other types but itself. What makes the comparison of type <code>int</code> and <code>traffic_light</code> possible, is because compiler will promote one type to the other one having higher rank. So in this case, <code>traffic_light</code> will be promoted to type <code>int</code> and <b>switch case</b> statement compares the values.</p>

<p>By default, <code>enum class</code> has only following predefined operatrs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assignment <code>operator=</code></li>
	<li>Initialization <code>operator{...}</code></li>
	<li>Comparison <code>operators==</code></li>
</ul>

<p>But more operators can be implemented on <code>enum class</code>es too. For example, we can make an enumeration object increment by one using <code>++operator</code>, which is discussed in <a href="/cpp/fundamentals/program-flow/switch-case/">postfix and prefix operators</a>.</p>

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		TrafficLight light = TrafficLight::yellow;

		// prefix increment operator++ (operator overloading is discussed later)
		TrafficLight& operator++ (TrafficLight& light) {
			switch (light) {
				case TrafficLight::red : light = TrafficLight::yellow;
				case TrafficLight::yellow : light = TrafficLight::green;
				case TrafficLight::green : light = TrafficLight::red;
			}
			return light;
		}

		++light; // using operator++ , now light is yellow
	</code>
</pre>
