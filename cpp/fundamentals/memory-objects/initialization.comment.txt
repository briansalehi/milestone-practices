Avoid Narrowing Conversion Errors by Using List Initialization.

When you initialize a variable of a smaller integer type (say, short) using
another of a larger type (say, an int), you are risking a narrowing conversion
error, because the  compiler has to fit data stored in a type that can
potentially hold much larger numbers into a type that doesn’t have the same
capacity (that is, is narrower).

Narrowing isn’t restricted to conversions between integer types only. You may
face  narrowing errors if you initialize a float using a double, a float (or
double) using an int, or an int using a float. Some compilers may warn, but
this warning will not cause an error that stops compilation. In such cases,
you may be confronted by bugs that occur infrequently and at execution time.

To avoid this problem, C++11 recommends list initialization techniques that
prevent  narrowing. To use this feature, insert initialization
values/variables within braces {…}.

There are two types of initialization that use braced initializer lists:

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		// Copy list initialization
		T obj = {arg1, arg2, ...};

		// Direct list initialization
		T obj{arg1, arg2, ...};
	</code>
</pre>

In combination with auto type deduction, there is an important difference
between copy and direct list initialization introduced with C++17.

Starting with C++17, you have the following results:

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		// Copy list initialization
		auto a = {11}; // initializer_list&lt;int&gt;
		auto b = {11, 22}; // initializer_list&lt;int&gt;

		// Direct list initialization
		auto c{11}; // int
		auto d{11, 22}; // Error, too many elements.
	</code>
</pre>

Note that for copy list initialization, all the elements in the braced
initializer must be of the same type. For example, the following does not
compile:

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		auto b = {11, 22.33}; // Compilation error
	</code>
</pre>

In earlier versions of the standard (C++11/14), both copy and direct list
initialization deduce an initializer_list&lt;&gt; :

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		// Copy list initialization
		auto a = {11}; // initializer_list&lt;int&gt;
		auto b = {11, 22}; // initializer_list&lt;int&gt;

		// Direct list initialization
		auto c {11}; // initializer_list&lt;int&gt;
		auto d {11, 22}; // initializer_list&lt;int&gt;
	</code>
</pre>
