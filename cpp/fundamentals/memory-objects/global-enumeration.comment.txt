<p>in previous practice, enumeration was introduced by class expression, though, inherited by C, in C++ enumerations can also be declared by only <i>enum</i> keyword. Though, there is a big difference between <i>enum</i> and <i>enum class</i> declared enumerations.</p>

<p>Enumeration members defined by <i>enum</i> are visible globally, but enumberation members defined by <i>enum class</i> are scoped (next practice) and their scope must be specified before use. Generally, it's best practice to avoid globals.</p>
