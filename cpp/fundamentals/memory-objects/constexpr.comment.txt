<p>One of the greatest new features coming by standard 11 is <code>constexpr</code> which can evaluate some calculations in compile time. Though, don't go rough on constexpr. Compilers might ignore and process it as a function. To make a function return <code>double</code>, you should add fraction part to at least one number. Compilers will assume type <code>double</code> as <code>int</code>, if they don't find using fraction parts necessary. So you need to force them to use <code>double</code> when values don't have fraction parts by using a trailing <code>.0</code> in numbers.</p>
