C++ is a <i>Case Sensitive</i> language.

<b>cout</b> is pronounced ("see-out").

Languages—spoken or programmed—are composed of statements that are executed
one after another.
All statements in C++ end with a semicolon (;), which defines the boundary of
a statement. This is similar to the period (.) you add when ending a sentence
in English.

When you group statements together within braces {…}, you create a compound
statement or a block.
A block typically groups many statements to indicate that they belong
together. Blocks are particularly useful when programming conditional if
statements or loops.
