**continue** will skip one iteration of a loop, and **break**
will escape from the scope of a loop and stops iteration.

Don't use too many breaks, they make loops hard to follow.  
Programmers expect to read a program from top to bottom and
finally find only one way that ends a loop or program itself.  
Using too many breaks, return and exit statements, make your program's
predictability hard to follow.
