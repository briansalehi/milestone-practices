The objective of switch-case is to enable you to check a particular expression
against a host of possible constants and possibly perform a different action
for each of those different values. The new C++ keywords you would often find
in such a construct are <b>switch</b>, <b>case</b>, <b>default</b>, and
<b>break</b>.
