<p>C++ is a <i>Case Sensitive</i> language.</p>

<p><b>cout</b> is pronounced ("see-out").</p>

<p>Languages—spoken or programmed—are composed of statements that are executed one after another. All statements in C++ end with a semicolon (;), which defines the boundary of a statement. This is similar to the period (.) you add when ending a sentence in English.</p>

<p>When you group statements together within braces {…}, you create a compound statement or a block. A block typically groups many statements to indicate that they belong together. Blocks are particularly useful when programming conditional if statements or loops.</p>
