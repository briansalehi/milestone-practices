<p>Like many programming languages, creating and running a C++ program requires several steps.</p>

<p>First, we create a C++ source file into which we enter the lines of our program. After we save this file, we then run a program, called a compiler, which generates a machine-code interpretation of this program.</p>

<p>Another program, called a linker (which is typically invoked automatically by the compiler), includes any required library code functions needed and produces the final machine-executable file.</p>

<p>Compilation process is done in the following steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>source code</b>: the language syntax we deal with, and what we have to write in one or more source files with .cxx or .cpp extension</li>
	<li><b>compiler</b>: a step that compiler reads our source files and converts them into machine language, normally a tool like g++ called as a command</li>
	<li><b>object code</b>: files written in machine code, generated by compilers, and ready to be linked together or with shared libraries</li>
	<li><b>linker</b>: a tool which links all object codes together or with shared libraries in a system dynamically or statically</li>
	<li><b>executable code</b>: a completely machine comprehensive file ready to be executed on a system</li>
</ul>
