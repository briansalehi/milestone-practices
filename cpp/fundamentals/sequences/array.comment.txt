Initialier lists can also hold multiple values and assign them onto
an array or similar containers which we will discuss soon.

**Note:** when arrays are declared and left uninitialized, they hold garbage data as their values.
It is best practice to always initialize an array with zero. In case of initializing an array with
an initializer list, all of its elements will be assigned to zero.
