<b>auto</b> type is a way to let compiler deduce a type and replace it in
compile type.

Using auto requires you to initialize the variable for the compiler that uses
this initial value in deciding what the variable type can be.

When you donâ€™t initialize a variable of type auto, you get a  compile error.

Using auto type sometimes makes your code shorter, specially when it comes to
iterators, which will be discussed later.

Just like anything in your daily life, type <b>auto</b> has its cons too.
Your code might look easier to read by using type <b>auto</b>, but be aware
that using too many <b>auto</b> types will make types hard to guess and soon
your program will look confusing, as all types are no longer explicitely
visible!

Personally, I prefer using explicit types wherever possible, even if they make
my code longer, at least I won't end up guessing my variable types.
