This is a C++ program sample.

C++ joins three separate programming categories:  

* the procedural language: represented by C
* the object-oriented language: represented by the class enhancements C++ adds to C
* generic programming: supported by C++ templates

So, C++ **is** a generic programming language.

This is how we compile a cxx source code in Linux OS using g++ or the compiler of your favor:

    g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o source source.cxx

Compilation process is done in the following steps:

* **source code**: the language syntax we deal with, and what we have to write in one or more source files with .cxx or .cpp extension
* **compiler**: a step that compiler reads our source files and converts them into machine language, normally a tool like g++ called as a command
* **object code**: files written in machine code, generated by compilers, and ready to be linked together or with shared libraries
* **linker**: a tool which links all object codes together or with shared libraries in a system dynamically or statically
* **executable code**: a completely machine comprehensive file ready to be executed on a system
