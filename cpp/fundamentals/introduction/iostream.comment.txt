<p>Instead of saying that my program "<i>prints something</i>" on display, we should say that my program "<i>sends something to the output stream</i>". Somehow, it's more impressive!</p>

<p>Some might argue about using <code>\n</code> over <code>std::endl</code> as newline. Well, the only big difference is that <code>std::endl</code> promises to flush the output stream. It means that the program will wait until newline character is printed. It is possible on some systems in some circumstances a prompt might not be displayed until after you enter the information being prompted for. Personally, I use <code>\n</code> when I'm printing a string in output stream and use <code>std::endl</code> otherwise.</p>
