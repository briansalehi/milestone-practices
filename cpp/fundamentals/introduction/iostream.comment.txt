Instead of saying that my program prints something on display, we should say
that my program sends something to the output stream.
Somehow, it's more impressive!

Some might argue about using "\n" over std::endl as newline.
Well, the only big difference is that <b>std::endl</b> promises to flush the
output stream.  
It means that the program will wait until newline character is printed.  
It is possible on some systems in some circumstances a prompt might not be
displayed until after you enter the information being prompted for.  
Personally, I use "\n" when I'm printing a string in output stream and use
<b>std::endl</b> otherwise.
