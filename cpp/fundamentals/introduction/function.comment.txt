<p><b>main</b> function, as the name suggests is the main function that always exists in all C and C++ programs.</p>

<p>All other functions must be defined before <i>main function</i>. Either they can only be declared before main and implemented after main, or they can be implemented in one step before main function.</p>

<p>All functions either return an object type using return statement or not. In case of non-returning functions, return type is <b>void</b>.</p>
