<p>For programs of any significant size, placing all the code inside of <code>main()</code> is unmanageable. To make programs easy to understand, you need to break up, or decompose, code into concise functions.</p>

<p><b>Functions</b> give you a way to compartmentalize and organize your programâ€™s execution logic. They enable you to split the contents of your application into logical blocks that are invoked sequentially.</p>

<p>A function is hence a subprogram that optionally takes parameters and returns a value, and it needs to be invoked to perform its task.</p>

<p>The term function signature is user to denote the combination of the function name and its parameter list, but without the return type.</p>
