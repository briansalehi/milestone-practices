Functions give you a way to compartmentalize and organize your programâ€™s
execution logic. They enable you to split the contents of your application
into logical blocks that are invoked sequentially.

A function is hence a subprogram that optionally takes parameters and returns
a value, and it needs to be invoked to perform its task.
