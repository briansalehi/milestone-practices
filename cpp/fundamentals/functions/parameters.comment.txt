Considering the design of a clean code, a function should not have more than
two arguments, at most three.  
What you usually try to give to a function can be put in a larger structure.  
Say, you want to give a function three variables:

<pre class="language-cpp">
	<code>
		void function(char* book_title, int book_pages, int book_price);
	</code>
</pre>

Instead, you can create a structure named <b>Book</b> containing:  

<pre class="language-cpp">
	<code>
		struct Book {
			char* title;
			int pages;
			int price;
		} book;
	</code>
</pre>

And call the function with one argument:

<pre class="language-cpp">
	<code>
		void function(Book book) {
			// do something with book.title, book.pages, book.price
		}
	</code>
</pre>
