The function prototype basically tells what a function is called, the list of
parameters the function accepts, and the return type of the function.

Any function in a C++ program must be declared before the main function.  
This can be done in two ways:

<ul>
<li>Write function declaration before <b>main</b> and then write function
definition after it</li>
<li>Write function definition before <b>main</b> once</li>
</ul>

The actual meat and potatoes the implementation of a function is what is
called the definition.

A function definition is always comprised of a statement block. A return
statement is necessary unless the function is declared with return type void.

Calling a function is the same as invoking one. When a function declaration
contains parameters, the function call needs to send arguments. Arguments are
values the function requests within its parameter list.
