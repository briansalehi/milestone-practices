The function prototype basically tells what a function is called, the list of
parameters the function accepts, and the return type of the function.

Any function in a C++ program must be declared before the main function.  
This can be done in two ways:

<ul>
<li>Write function declaration before <b>main</b> and then write function
definition after it</li>
<li>Write function definition before <b>main</b> once</li>
</ul>
