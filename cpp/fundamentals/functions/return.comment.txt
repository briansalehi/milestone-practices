When programming a function that does not need to return any value, specify
the return type as <b>void</b>.

As we discussed earlier, multiple return statements can be confusing as all
programs are expected to be ended in their last line.

Avoid multiple return statements, there is always a better way to do what you
are going to do with multiple return statements.

For example, in the following source code, isEven() could be substituted by:

<pre class="language-cpp">
	<code>
		bool isEven(int number)
		{
			return (number % 2) == 0 ? true : false;
		}
	</code>
</pre>

You are not restricted to having only one return statement in your function
definition.
You can return from any point in the function, and multiple times if you want.
Depending on the logic and the need of the application, this might or might
not be poor programming practice.
