In certain cases, you can actually have a function call itself. Such a
function is called a recursive function. Note that a recursive function should
have a very clearly defined exit condition where it returns without invoking
itself again.

To use a function recursively, we must be sure we have a break condition in
our function to break the recursion steps somewhere, unless you want to watch
your system run out of memory! nothing dangerious will happen in that case as
your operating system will stop your program's execution and throws an
exception due to too much memory consumption.

In the absence of an exit condition or in the event of a bug in the same, your
program execution gets stuck at the recursive function that won’t stop
invoking itself, and this eventually stops when the “stack overflows,” causing
an application crash.

Recursive functions are useful in many cases, but in powerful systems!

You shouldn't use recursive functions in embedded systems as they consume a
huge amount of memory.
