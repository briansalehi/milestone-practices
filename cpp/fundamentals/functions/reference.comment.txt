Passing an array as a function parameter is simply done by using the address of its first element.  
You might already noticed that variables can also be passed to functions parameters by their addresses.  
This way, it doesn't matter how big value is a variable holding, we just pass its address as a parameter.  
using & character behind a variable's name, we access to the variable's address in memory.
