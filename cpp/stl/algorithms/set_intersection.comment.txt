as discussed in **std::set_union** practice page, intersections.begin() iterator
cannot be used as an output iterator for two reasons:

* begin() returns a constant key but **std::set_intersection** needs to change container values
* std::set_intersection like **std::copy** does not allocate new space in an empty container,
but **std::insert_iterator** solves this problem.
iterators are discussed later in iterators chapter.
