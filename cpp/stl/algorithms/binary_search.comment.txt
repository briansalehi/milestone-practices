<p>To search fast, STL provides you with <code>binary_search()</code> that is effective only on a sorted container:</p>

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers">
	<code>
		bool elementFound = binary_search(numsInVec.begin(), numsInVec.end(), 2011);
		if (elementFound)
			std::cout << "Element found in the vector!" << std::endl;
	</code>
</pre>

<p>Algorithms such as <code>binary_search()</code> are effective only in sorted containers. Use of this algorithm on an unsorted vector can have undesirable consequences.</p>
