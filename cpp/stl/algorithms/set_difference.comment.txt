as discussed in std::set_union practice page, differences.begin() iterator
cannot be used as an output iterator for two reasons:

* begin() returns a constant key but _std::set_difference_ needs to change container values
* _std::set_difference_ like _std::copy_ does not allocate new space in an empty container,
but **std::insert_iterator** solves this problem.
iterators are discussed later in iterators chapter.
