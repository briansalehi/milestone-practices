<p>You can have random access to data of a file using <code>seekg()</code> for input file (seek get), and <code>seekp()</code> function for output file (seek put). Both functions get parameter type of <code>std::streampos</code> class.</p>  

<p>To calculate the position of a data, you must multiply a type of <code>long</code> to the <code>sizeof</code> single data written in that file. That is, working file must contain a sequence of similar data type.</p>
