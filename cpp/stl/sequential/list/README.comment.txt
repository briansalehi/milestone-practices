<p>A linked list is a collection of nodes in which each node, in addition to containing a value or object of interest, also points to the next node</p>

<p>The STL implementation of the list class allows for constant-time insertions in the top, bottom, or middle of the list.</p>

<p>To use class <code>std::list</code>, include header: <code>&lt;list&gt;</code></p>
