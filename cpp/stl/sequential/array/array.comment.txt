<p>There is a substitution for C-style arrays in C++11 and that is <code>array&lt;type, length&gt;</code> template class in <code>&lt;array&gt;</code> header file. <code>std::array</code> class has consistency and is more secure over C-style array and should be used when arrays are needed.</p>

<p>There are a number of advantages to using <code>std::arrays</code> instead of C-style arrays. They always know their own size, are not automatically cast to a pointer to avoid certain types of bugs, and have iterators to easily loop over the elements.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates how to use the array container. The use of angle brackets after array, as in <code>array&lt;int, 3&gt;</code>, will become clear during the discussion of templates.</p>
