<p><code>std::vector</code> is a template class that supplies generic functionality of a dynamic array and features the following characteristics:</p>

<p>Addition of elements to the end of the array in constant time; that is, the time needed to insert at the end is not dependent on the size of the array. Ditto for removal of an element at the end.</p>

<p>The time required for the insertion or removal of elements at the middle is directly proportional to the number of elements behind the element being removed.</p>

<p>The number of elements held is dynamic, and the vector class manages the  memory usage.</p>

<p>To use class <code>std::vector</code>, include header: <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code></p>
