<p>Stacks are LIFO (last-in-first-out) systems where elements can be inserted or removed at the top of the container.</p>

<p>This behavior of a stack of plates is simulated in the generic STL container <code>std::stack</code>.</p>

<p>To use class <code>std::stack</code>, include header <code>&lt;stack&gt;</code></p>
