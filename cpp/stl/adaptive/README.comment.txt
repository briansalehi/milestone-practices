<p>The Standard Template Library (STL) features containers that adapt others to simulate stack and queue behavior. Such containers that internally use another and present a distinct behavior are called adaptive containers.</p>

<p>Stacks and queues are like arrays or lists but present a restriction on how elements are inserted, accessed, and removed.</p>
