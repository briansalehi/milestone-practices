<p>Queues are FIFO (first-in-first-out) systems where elements can be inserted behind the previous one, and the one inserted first gets removed first.</p>

<p>This behavior of a queue is simulated in the generic STL container <code>std::queue</code>.</p>

<p>To use class <code>std::queue</code>, include header <code>&lt;queue&gt;</code></p>
