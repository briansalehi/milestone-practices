Inserting elements into **std::map** container differs from previous containers we have practiced so far.  
To do so, we can use one of the following approaches:

* using **.value_type(key, value)** method
* using **make_pair(key, value)** function
* using **pair<key type, value type>(key, value)** class

Each one is self-explanatory in practice.
