Classes that contain only function operator are called function objects, as they
can be only used when are called just like functions.  
Functions objects have an advantage over lambda functions (discussed later),
that which they can be used multiple times while lambda functions must be
implemented where they should be called. Another advantage is that function
objects can contain more lines of code while lambda functions are strongly
recommended to be as short as possible.
