**operators** are fully discussed in their own chapter, but there is a little useful operator used with string objects, called **string literal operator**.  
Notice that when you use \0 character in a string you are actually breaking that string as they represent the end of strings.  
Actually this character is a part of special character list and they can be parsed in your string to do tasks or make signs in a string.  
To make special characters to look just as they are written, use **s** operator at the end of a string literal.
