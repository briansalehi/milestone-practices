# 08 Boost Libraries

**NOTE: This is a big section and you should already be familiar with boost

This section is an introduction to some of useful boost libraries to make Cxx
practices more practical and complete.  
I cover as many details as I can but you should also consult online boost
documentations meanwhile practicing.
