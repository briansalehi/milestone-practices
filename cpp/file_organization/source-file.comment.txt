There are two common file types, source files and header files. Source files typi-
cally contain most of the executable statements and data definitions. This includes
the bodies of functions and definitions of any global variables.

Each nonconstant global variable and function may be defined only once. Other
source files may share such a global variable or function provided they have a
matching declaration. To indicate that a global variable is defined in another file,
the type specifier “extern” is added. This keyword is not needed for functions.

For example, consider the declarations extracted from two files below. The file
Source1.cpp defines a global variable cat and function foo. The file Source2.cpp
can access these objects by including the appropriate matching declarations and
adding “extern” for variables.

File: Source1.cpp

```cxx
int cat = 1;
int foo(int x) { return x+1; }
```

File: Source2.cpp

```cxx
extern int cat;
int foo(int x);
```
