<p>The preprocessor, as the name indicates, is what runs before the compiler starts. In other words, the preprocessor actually decides what is compiled on the basis of how you instruct it. Preprocessor directives are characterized by the fact that they all start with a <code>#</code> (pound) sign.</p>

<p>Macros are also about text substitution. The preprocessor does nothing intelligent beyond replacing in-place the identifier by another text.</p>
