<p>Be careful using macro functions, you might easily make mistakes. Keep in mind that macros are only compile-time string substitutions in your code. Let's say we have this function:</p>

<pre class="language-cpp">
	<code>
		#define SQUARED(x) (x * x)
	</code>
</pre>

<p>If you set <code>x</code> as <code>3+2</code>, compiler will see this as <code>(3+2 * 3+2)</code>. considering mathematical precedence, <code>2*3</code> will be first evaluated. So to make sure your macro functions work as they supposed to, surround them with parenthesis.</p>
