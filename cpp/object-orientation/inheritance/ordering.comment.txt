Constructors are the first methods invoked when an object is created and destructors are the last methods invoked before an object cease to exist.  
When an object is created, constructors of its parents are first invoked from top to bottom and in the time of destruction, destructors are invoked from bottom to top. Actually the *Base* class has the first constructor and last destructor being invoked.
