<p>C++ allows a class to derive from two or more base classes:</p>

<pre class="language-cpp line-numbers" data-line="1">
	<code>
		class Derived: access-specifier Base1, access-specifier Base2
		{
			// class members
		};
	</code>
</pre>

<p>It essentially does nothing more than inherit from the three classes. All of public and protected members and methods in base classes are accessible to the derived class as usual.</p>
