Unions too, are classes in C++ and their members are public by default unless otherwise is specified.  
Unions can be used in complex types as we did here in this practice.  
They have the same concept as they have in C. Only one member of a union can be occupied at a time.

**note**: coding style is a matter of your taste, you can specify your variables and names in camelCase format, PasCal format or not to use capital letters at all, eg. ComplexType, complexType, complex_type.
