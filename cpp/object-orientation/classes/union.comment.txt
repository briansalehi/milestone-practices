<p>Unions too, are classes in C++ and their members are public by default unless otherwise is specified.</p>  
<p>Unions can be used in complex types as we did here in this practice.</p>  
<p>They have the same concept as they have in C. Only one member of a union can be occupied at a time.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: coding style is a matter of your taste, you can specify your variables and names in camelCase format, PasCal format or not to use capital letters at all, eg. ComplexType, complexType, complex_type.</p>
