<p>To access private memebers of a class, you either can declare a method inside that class to return the value of that private member, or you make a foreign function friends with that class to give it access to private member of the class. Either way, you need the declaration of those methods inside the class.</p>

<p>To specify a foreign function as a friend, you need to write the declaration of that function with keyword <i>friend</i> in the head of declaration. You only have to specify <i>friend</i> keyword before function declaration inside the class not in definition of that function outside the class.</p>  

<p>This practice only shows you how to define a friend class, it will not tell you where you can use it.</p>
<p><i>friend</i> functions will be discussed more in operator overloadings.</p>
