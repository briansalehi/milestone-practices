<p>Constructors are the methods in classes having the same name of the class.</p>
<p>They are invoked right after an object is created.</p>
<p>Either they can have arguments or not.</p>
<p>Constructors have no return value.</p>

<p>An important aspect of classes is the capability to initialize a classâ€™s member data. A constructor is a special member function whose task is to perform such an initialization. It is invoked when a new class object comes into existence. There is an analogous destructor member function that is called when a class object goes out of existence.</p>
