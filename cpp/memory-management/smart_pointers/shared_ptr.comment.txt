<p>When writing applications using multiple threads, evaluate using <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::weak_ptr</code> supplied by C++11-compliant libraries. These facilitate thread-safe and reference-counted object sharing.</p>

<p>Shared pointers, will copy the address and ownership of the pointed object. This makes them useful when you want a few pointers point to one location. <code>delete</code> operator will be called when the last pointer is destroyed.</p>
