In this practice there are comments representing the regular mistakes programmers do.  

* allocate pointers with new and set them to **nullptr** if not initialized with a valid address.
* in conditional statements, don't miss possible values of pointers, don't leave them pointing to invalid address.
* before deleting a block of memory created by new, first check if they have allocated first.
