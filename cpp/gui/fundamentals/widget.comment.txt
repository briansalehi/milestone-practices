<p>Widgets are the graphical components with which we construct user interfaces.</p>

<p>An application's main window should be constructed by <code>QMainWindow</code> object which itself is derived from <code>QWidget</code> class but specialized for this purpose.</p>

<cite>Class hierarchy in Qt</cite>
![qt-objects-hierarchy.png]

<p>
At the very top of the hierarchy is the <code>QObject</code>.<br/>
A lot of classes inherit from the <code>QObject</code> class.<br/>
The <code>QObject</code> class also contains the mechanisms of signals and slots and event management, among other things.

<p>There are a few critical points to note regarding widgets in Qt:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Information is passed to widgets by way of events.</li>
	<li>Every widget can have a parent widget or children widgets.</li>
	<li>Widgets that do not have a parent widget become a window when the <code>show()</code> function is called on them. Such a widget will be enclosed in a window with buttons to close, maximize, and minimize it.</li>
	<li>A child widget is displayed within its parent widget.</li>
</ul>
