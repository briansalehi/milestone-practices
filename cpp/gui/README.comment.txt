<p>This section holds essential parts of Qt framework to practice.</p>

<p>Do be aware that Qt does include a small amount of features that only work on specific platforms. However, these are minimal and often for special use cases, such as Qt Sensors, which only work on mobile platforms; Qt Web Engine, which only works on desktops; Qt NFC, only for Android and Linux; and so on.</p>
