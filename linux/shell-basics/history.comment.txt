Normally, your shell keeps a history of the previous commands you executed.
You can access to this history by <i>history</i> command.

You can run previous command by !! which first indicates the command, then
its results.

You can also specifically choose a command in history and run again by its ID.

And finally, you can clear shell history by <b>-c</b> option.

For security reasons, you might want to frequently do that.
One reason to do this is that you may have typed a passphrase or a sensitive
information in command line and now itâ€™s stored in shell history.
