The Bash we use is a shell and is just a program that provies us an environment
to execute commands on a system. Some commands are built-in and they come
with the shell program itself, which are internal commands. <i>cd</i> and
<i>pwd</i> are two best known internal commands.

Other commands are said to be external commands. That is, they are programs
sitting somewhere and as we type their name on the shell and then hit enter the
shell executes them and they can run separately from the shell itself.

So, mkdir is a program separate from the shell sitting in the <b>/usr/bin/</b>
(pronounced slash USR slash BIN) directory. As we type mkdir on the shell,
shell will find this command in its corresponding directory and execute it.

How does shell know where to find external programs like <i>mkdir</i> to
execute them?
We will see later that Bash holds a few environment variables which hold
values to manage programs with.
PATH variables is one of the environment variables which contains a list of
directories separated by colon, each represent a directory which contains
executable files, runnable as commands.
