Most Linux software relies heavily on <i>shared libraries</i>.
Binary program files can point to libraries either by name alone or by
providing a complete path.

In the first case, you must configure a <b>library path</b>, a set of
directtories in which programs should search for libraries.

The first way to set the library patah is to edit /etc/ld.so.config file.
This file consists of a series of lines, each of which lists one directory in
which shared library files may be found.

Some distributions have an additional type of line in this file.
These lines begin with the include directive; they list files that are to be
included as if they were part of the main file.
These lines tell the system to load all of the files in /etc/ld.so.config.d/
whose names end in .config.

<h4>Temporarily Changing the Path</h4>
Sometimes it is necessary to change library path. For instance, you might want
to test the effect of a new library before using it for all off you programs.
To do so, you could install the shared libraries in an unusual location and
then set the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>.

To set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable using the bash shell, you can
type following command:

<pre>
	<code class="language-bash">
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.local/testlib:/opt/newlib
	</code>
</pre>

This line adds two directories, ~/.local/testlib and /opt/newlib, to the
search path.

<h4> correcting problems</h4>
Library path problems usually manifest as a program's inability to locate a
library.
First check if library is installed, if not, install it.
If library is installed but program cannot find it, check which library the
program is using by <b>ld</b> command.

<pre>
	<code class="language-bash">
		ldd /bin/ls
	</code>
</pre>

Sometimes, the library's path is har-coded in the program's binary file.
When this happens, you may need to create a symbolic link from the location of
the library on your sysstem to the location the program expects.

A similar problem can occur when the program expects a library to have one
name nut the library has another name.

<h4>Rebuilding the Library Cache</h4>
Linuux doesn't read /etc/ld.so.config every time a program runs.
Instead, the system relies on a cached list of directories and the files they
contain stored in a binary format in /etc/ld.so.cache.

To rebuild the cache run following command:

<pre>
	<code class="language-bash">
		ldconfig
	</code>
</pre>
