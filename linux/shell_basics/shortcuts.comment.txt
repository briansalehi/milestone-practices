It would be the best experience if you can touch type on your keyboard and use
your 10 fingers typing anything with least effort.

There are dozens of touch typing tutorial apps out there, just use one if you
don’t already know how to do it.

Usually programmers and admins prefer not to raise their hands for frequent
tasks.

So, for example you can reach to your previous commands you typed on shell
by hitting up and down arrow keys, which requires you to raise your hands and
move them to the top of arrow keys which seems to be a very long distance!
Instead, we can get used to using the shortcuts doing exact same thing without
raising our hands, as for up arrow key we use <b>Ctrl+P</b> and down arrow key
we use <b>Ctrl+N</b>.

* before you use <b>Ctrl+S</b> you need to know that it causes your terminal to
hang, to make your terminal continue running hit <b>Ctrl+Q</b> afterwards.
Type <b>”stty -xion”</b> to make your terminal interpreting <b>Ctrl+S</b> as
search shortcut instead.

There’s a list of shell shortcuts that saves us time and energy:
