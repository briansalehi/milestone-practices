There are so many commands each having many options in the shell. How can
we manage?
There are a few ways we can get help when we need to know about a command
or we are looking for a command to do what we want.
Manual pages are widely used in Linux shells to give you information about the
available commands.
To get help of manual pages just type <i>man</i> command with the
investigating command in front.

Sometimes the command names themselve are forgotten.
In this case, description or closes match to what that command is can be
queried by man with a <i>-k</i> option.

We can see that we were looking for a pager and it introduced us the
<i>pager</i> command which we call it <i>less</i>.

There is also another tool for reading manuals, <i>info</i>.
Though, man pages are mostly used, info command is also pretty popular and
thereâ€™s a chance you need to work with it later.
