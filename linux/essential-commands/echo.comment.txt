<i>echo</i> command might seem nontrivial at first sight but it's usually the
most used command.

Prints a string or the value of a variable on shell.
Outputs can be redirected to files or to be piped to another command.

Only strings with duoble quote will expand variables.

Always embrace your variables and strings in quote.
