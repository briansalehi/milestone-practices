Word counter can be used to count lines of files, words of files, bytes of
files and more.

When -l is used to count numbers, wc counts newline characters, therefore,
lines without a trailing newline character won't count.

When -m is used to count characters, the result might be +1 character because
of newline character at the end of the line.
