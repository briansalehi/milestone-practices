Sed is a stream processing tool which has its own reputation and we will not
cover everything about it (we can't) in a single practice.

To learn sed in depth, visit
<a href="/linux/stream-processing/sed">stream processing</a> chapter.

We will cover the most basic and regularly used features of Sed here, which
are deleting and printing lines, and also substitution of strings.

Using Sed is straightforward, you call sed following options and then Sed
script surrounded by single quotes.
The Sed script itself follows a specific syntax, first the address of lines
can be given by numbers or string pattern, then a command is followed by that
address to give desired results.

<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
sed options '/address/command'
</code>
</pre>

In case of addess, we are using line numbers in this example.
And for commands, we used <b>d</b> to delete mentioned lines.
We used <b>p</b> to print specified lines, which requires -n to avoid
duplicate printing of lines, simply because sed itself also prints lines
alongside our print command.
And then we used <b>s</b> to substitute word <i>amazing</i> to <i>useful</i>.
