# Concepts

Redhat based distributions packages cannot be installed on Debian based distributions and vice versa.  
There are tools like **alien** to install binary packages on incompatible systems, but they have different databases.
**rpm** and **dpkg** tools do not identify these installed packages as one of system libraries, so you cannot install any package based on them.
