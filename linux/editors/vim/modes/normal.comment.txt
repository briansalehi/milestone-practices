Normal mode is Vim’s natural resting state.

The general theme used to type commands is as follows:

Other text editors spend most of their time in something that resembles Insert
mode. So to the Vim newcomer, it can seem strange that Normal mode is the
default.

Much of the power of Normal mode stems from the way that operator commands can
be combined with motions.

Many Normal mode commands can be executed with a count, which causes them to
be run multiple times. (see [<b>:h count</b>] )

The <mark>&lt;C-a&gt;</mark> and <mark>&lt;C-x&gt;</mark> commands perform
addition and subtraction on numbers.
When run without a count they increment by one, but if we prefix a number,
then we can add or subtract by any whole number. For example, if we positioned
our cursor on a 5 character, running <mark>10&lt;C-a&gt;</mark> would modify
it to read 15.
But what happens if the cursor is not positioned on a numeric digit? The
documentation says that the <mark>&lt;C-a&gt;</mark> command will “add
[count] to the number at or after the cursor” (see [<b>:h ctrl-a</b> ). So
if the cursor is not already positioned on a number, then the
<mark>&lt;C-a&gt;</mark> command will look ahead for a digit on the cur-rent
line.

Just because you can save keystrokes by using a count doesn’t mean that
you should. Later, we’ll see sometimes it’s better simply to repeat a
command than take the time to count how many times you want to run it.
