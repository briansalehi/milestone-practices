In Vim's practices, the $ symbol indicates that a command line is to be
executed in an external shell, whereas the : prompt indicates that the command
line is to be executed internally from Command-Line mode.

Occasionally weâ€™ll see other prompts, including these:

<table class="table table-dark">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Pormpt</th>
			<th scope="col">Meaning</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>$</td>
			<td>Enter the command line in an external shell</td>
		</td>
		<tr>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>Use command line mode to execute an Ex command</td>
		</td>
		<tr>
			<td>/</td>
			<td>Use command line mode to perform a forward search</td>
		</td>
		<tr>
			<td>?</td>
			<td>Use command line mode to perform a backward search</td>
		</td>
		<tr>
			<td>=</td>
			<td>Use command line mode to evaluate a Vim script expression</td>
		</td>
	</tbody>
</table>
