(See <b>:h count</b> )

We can minimize the keystrokes required to perform certain tasks by providing
a count, but that doesn't mean that we should. Consider the pros and cons of
counting versus repeating.

Considering an example of deleting two words.
Both <mark>d2w</mark> and <mark>2dw</mark> will work. With <mark>d2w</mark>,
we invoke the delete command and then give <mark>2w</mark> as the motion. We
could read that as "delete two words." However, <mark>d2w</mark> turns things
around. This time the count applies to the delete command, but the motion acts
over a single word. We could read this as "delete a word two times." Putting
semantics aside, we get the same result either way.

Now let's consider an alternative: <mark>dw.</mark>. This we can read as
"Delete a word and then repeat."

Now suppose that we want to delete seven words. We could either run
<mark>d7w</mark>, or <mark>dw......</mark> (that is, <mark>dw</mark> followed
by the dot command six times).

Counting is tedious. I'd rather hit the dot command six times than spend the
same time looking ahead in order to reduce the number of keys that I have to
press.

In opposite, in some scenario it doesn't make much sense to use the dot
command. We could delete one word and then another (with the dot command), but
then we'd have to switch gears and change to Insert mode (using i or cw, for
example). To me, that feels awkward enough that I'd rather go ahead and use a
count.
