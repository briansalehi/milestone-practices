[<bold>:h +feature-list</bold>]
<br/>

Some of Vimâ€™s functionality can be disabled during compilation. For
example, when configuring the build, we could provide the --with-features=tiny
option, which would disable all but the most fundamental features (there are
also feature sets labeled small, normal, big, and huge). You can browse the
feature list by looking up [<bold>:h +feature-list</bold>]
