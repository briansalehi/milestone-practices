# Technical Practice Pages

This is a collection of Assembly, C and C++ practice programs.

I regularly update this repository while I study my books.  
There is a list of resources in each section used to write practices.  
Studying resources are totally recommended!

A wide range of topics are covered in Assembly, C and C++ programming languages,
from their syntax, semantics, algorithms and data structures, to MCU
programming, Linux device drivers, image processing, machine learning.

**NOTE:** _all practices are Unix based only, except the standard ones._

It is getting harder not to forget the fact that by no means, no one
will ever become a professional by only surfing on the web and searching only for
the problems they face. But to become a professional you need to spend so much time
and effort on books, projects and daily practices. Don't be fooled by the speed
of your internet connection, you are not that fast! It takes a lot of time and
patience to become good at something. Read books people!

# Brief Content

Major topics covered in this repository are separate practice repositories by
themselves but this repository is an easy access to all of the topics making
them seem like they merged into one.

* Linux System Administration
* Assembly Programming Language
* C Programmig Language
* C++ Programming Language
* Mathematics
* Machine Learning

Some topics depend to one another.  
All of topics are covered only in Linux environment, so that would be wise to
learn Linux first, maybe a course would be better for a start, and then some
books.  
Learning Assembly before C is optional but it's recommended, so as learning C++
after C.  
Machine learning is heavily based on mathematics, so that too, is better to
learn first.

# Usage

Practice pages are available
[online](https://github.com/briansalehi/practice-pages.git), or can be
downloaded to use later [offline](http://briansalehi.ir/pratices/offline).  
Practices are heavily being developed and are frequently changed, so reading
online is recommended or make sure you frequently download the latest offline
source.
