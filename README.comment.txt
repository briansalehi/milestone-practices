This is a collection of programming language practices.

I regularly update this repository while I study my books.  
There is a list of resources in each section used to write practices.  
Studying resources are totally recommended!

A wide range of topics are covered in Assembly, C, C++ and Python programming
languages.
Practices cover everything from syntax, semantics, algorithms and
data structures, to MCU programming, Linux device drivers, image processing,
mathematics and machine learning.

It is getting harder not to forget the fact that by no means, no one
will ever become an expert by only surfing on the web and only searching
the problems they face. But it takes so much time and effort to read all the
books and to take all the specialization courses to become an expert.
Don't be fooled by the speed of your internet connection, you are not that
fast! It takes a lot of time and patience to become really good at something.
Read books people!
And then practice, practice, practice!

Major topics covered in this repository are separate practice repositories by
themselves, mostly written by me (Brian Salehi) and other contributors who
make this project more valuable.

Some of the practices follow these topics in general:

<ul>
<li>Linux System Administration</li>
<li>Assembly Programming Language</li>
<li>C Programmig Language</li>
<li>C++ Programming Language</li>
<li>Python Programming Language</li>
<li>Java Programming Langauge</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul></li>

Some topics depend to one another.  
All of topics are covered only in Linux environment, so that would be wise to
learn Linux first, maybe a course would be better for a start, and then some
books.  
Learning Assembly before C is optional but it's recommended, so as learning C++
after C.  
Machine learning is heavily based on mathematics, so that too, is better to
be learned after.

Please contribute to this project and share your knowledge with others!
