<p>This is a collection of programming language practices.</p>

<p>I regularly update this repository while I study my books. There is a list of resources in each section used to write practices. Studying resources are totally recommended!</p>

<p>A wide range of topics are covered in Assembly, C, C++ and Python programming languages. Practices cover everything from syntax, semantics, algorithms and data structures, to MCU programming, Linux device drivers, image processing, mathematics and machine learning.</p>

<p>It is getting harder not to forget the fact that by no means, no one will ever become an expert by only surfing on the web and only searching the problems they face. But it takes so much time and effort to read all the books and to take all the specialization courses to become an expert. Don't be fooled by the speed of your internet connection, you are not that fast! It takes a lot of time and patience to become really good at something. Read books people! And then practice, practice, practice!</p>

<p>Major topics covered in this repository are separate practice repositories by themselves, mostly written by me (Brian Salehi) and other contributors who make this project more valuable.</p>

<p>Please contribute to this project and share your knowledge with others!</p>
