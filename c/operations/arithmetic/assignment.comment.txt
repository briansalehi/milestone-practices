Expressions such as

i = i + 2

in which the variable on the left hand side is repeated immediately on the right,  
can be written in the compressed form  

i += 2

The operator += is called an assignment operator.

Most binary operators (operators like + that have a left and right operand)  
have a corresponding assignment operator op =, where op is one of  

+ \- \* \/ %  << >> & ^ |

If expr1 and expr2 are expressions, then

epxr1 op= expr2

is equivalent to

expr1 = (expr1 ) op (expr2 )

except that expr 1 is computed only once. Notice the parentheses around expr2:  

X \*= y + 1

means

X= X \* (y + 1)

rather than

x = x \* y + 1
