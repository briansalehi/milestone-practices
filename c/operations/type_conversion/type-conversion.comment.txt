When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted to a  
common type according to a small number of rules. In general, the only  
automatic conversions are those that convert a "narrower" operand into a  
"wider" one without losing information, such as converting an integer  
to floating point in an expression like f + i. Expressions that don't make  
sense, like using a float as a subscript, are disallowed. Expressions that  
might lose information, like assigning a longer integer type to a shorter,  
or a floating-point type to an integer, may draw a warning,  
but they are not illegal.
