# Network Programming

Implementing a useful network requires solving a large number of different problems.
To keep things manageable and modular, different protocols are designed to solve different
sets of problems. TCP/IP is one such collection of solutions, sometimes called a protocol suite.
It happens to be the suite of protocols used in the Internet, but it can be used in stand-alone
private networks as well. Henceforth when we talk about the network, we mean any network
that uses the TCP/IP protocol suite. The main protocols in the TCP/IP suite are the Internet
Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
