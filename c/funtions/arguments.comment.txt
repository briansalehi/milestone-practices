In C, all function arguments are passed "by value".  
This means that the called function is given the values of its  
arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to some  
different properties than are seen with "call by reference" languages like  
Fortran or with var parameters in Pascal, in which the called routine has access  
to the original argument, not a local copy.
