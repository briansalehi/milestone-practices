A function need not return a value; a return statement with no expression  
causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller, as does "falling  
off the end" of a function by reaching the terminating right brace. And the calling  
function can ignore a value returned by a function.

You may have noticed that there is a return statement at the end of main.  
Since main is a function like any other, it may return a value to its caller,  
which is in effect the environment in which the program was executed. Typically,  
a return value of zero implies normal termination; non-zero values signal  
unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of simplicity, we  
have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point, but  
we will include them hereafter, as a reminder that programs should return  
status to their environment.
