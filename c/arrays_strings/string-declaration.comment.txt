Strings are nothing but an array of type char, that is **char star** type.

Notice that there is a difference between:

```c
char letter = 'A';
```

and

```c
char* letter = "A";
```

The former is just a character but the latter is not just one character, but it's an array of two characters: 'A' and '\n'.
