This is the simplest C program ever!  
Basically it does nothing.

In every C program, **main** function must always exist because
it will be called as soon as the program starts. 
That is, when a program starts, the operating
system will invoke a function called **_start**
which it is written to be always calling
the **main** function when it is invoked.  
So basically, main function is not the first function
to be called in computer programs
but we must always use it as the first function in our programs.
