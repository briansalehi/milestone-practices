Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like,  
but "main" is special. Your program begins executing at the beginning of main.  
This means that every program must have a main somewhere.

The lines between /* */ are comment, which in this case explains briefly what  
the program does. Any characters between /* and */ are ignored by the compiler;  
they may be used freely to make a program easier to understand. Comments may  
appear anywhere a blank or tab or newline can.
