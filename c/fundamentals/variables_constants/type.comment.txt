The type int means that the variables listed are integers, by contrast with  
float, which means floating point, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional  
part. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are  
using; 16-bit ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are  
32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six  
significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10- 38 and 10+ 38.

C provides several other basic data types besides int and float, including:

* char	character-a single byte
* short	short integer
* long	long integer
* double	double-precision floating point

The sizes of these objects are also machine-dependent.
