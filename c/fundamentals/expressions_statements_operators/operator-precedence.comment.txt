Operators have precedence over each other, meaning that when we use
multiple operators in one statement, compiler will evaluate the
statement in precedence order.

The highest precedence in mathematial expressions is parenthesis,
so (1 + 4) would be evaluated first, then multiplication and division
operators have higher precedene over the others but both are on the same
priority.  
So 6 / 2 * 3 will be 1 and finally addition and multiplications are evaluated.  
Finally we will have 1 in result.
