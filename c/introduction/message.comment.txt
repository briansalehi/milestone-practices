The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs  
in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages,  
prints the word:

	hello, world

Now for some explanations about the program itself. A C program, whatever  
its size, consists of functions and variables. A function contains statements  
that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store  
values used during the computation.

	#include <stdio.h>

tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output  
library; this line appears at the beginning of many C source files.

Notice that \n represents only a single character. An escape sequence like  
\n provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type  
or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are \t for tab, \b  
for backspace, \" for the double quote, and \\ for the backslash itself.
