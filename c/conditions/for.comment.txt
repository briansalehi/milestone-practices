The for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while.  
Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by semicolons.  
The first part, the initialization is done once, before the loop proper  
is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the loop.  
This condition is evaluated; if it is true, the body of the loop is executed.  
Then the increment step is executed, and the condition re-evaluated.  
The loop termhates if the condition has become false.
