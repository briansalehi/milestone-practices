Implicit arithmetic conversions work. much as expected. In general, if an  
operator like + or * that takes two operands (a binary operator) has operands of  
different types, the "lower" type is promoted to the "higher" type before the  
operation proceeds. The result is of the higher type.

If there are no unsigned operands, however, the following informal set of  
rules will suffice:

* If either operand is long double, convert the other to long double.
* Otherwise, if either operand is double, convert the other to double.
* Otherwise, if either operand is float, convert the other to float.
* Otherwise, convert char and short to int.
* Then, if either operand is long, convert the other to long.
