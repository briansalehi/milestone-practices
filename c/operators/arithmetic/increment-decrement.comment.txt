C provides two unusual operators for incrementing and decrementing variables.  
The increment operator ++ adds 1 to its operand, while the decrement  
operator -- subtracts 1.

The unusual aspect is that ++ and -- may be used either as prefix operators  
(before the variable, as in ++n), or postfix (after the variable: n++). In both  
cases, the effect is to increment n. But the expression ++n increments n before  
its value is used, while n++ increments n after its value has been used. This  
means that in a context where the value is being used, not just the effect, ++n  
and n++ are different.
