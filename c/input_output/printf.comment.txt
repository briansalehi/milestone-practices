In a simple language, this program will write something on your screen.
But this sentence does not seem to represent the goal of this program
professionally!  
We are better to say:

> This program will write a string to the output buffer,
> and then it flushes the buffer contents into the screen!

That's it, what will actually happen when you want to print something on
your screen, is that you write a string surrounded by double quotes (")
into to a memory somewhere called the *output buffer* by **printf** function.
Then a special character like "\n" which represents the **newline character**
in the string, will flush that string from output buffer into the screen.

Flushing the buffer can also be done by **fflush** function, which will
be discussed further later on.
